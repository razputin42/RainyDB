        <text>The double scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over tens of thousands of years, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double scimitar is an expensive weapon, but few people ever have an opportunity to purchase one. If you're an elf, your blade could have a long and storied history. If you're not an elf, you might have stolen the weapon from a fallen foe or received it from a dying Valenar ally. If you work with your DM to create the story behind your double scimitar, you can start with the weapon at 1st level in place of a martial weapon normally granted by your class. However, it can be dangerous for a non-elf to carry a double scimitar. Valenar may demand its return or challenge you to prove that you're worthy to wield it.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    Special: When you take the attack action and make a two-handed attack with a double-bladed scimitar, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the blade at the opposite end of the weapon. This attack uses the same ability modifier as the primary attack. The weapon's damage die for this attack is a d4, and it deals slashing damage.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    You can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into the air and speak the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls.</text>
        <text>    While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.</text>
        <text>    After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</text>

        <text>     </text>
        <text>    You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</text>
        <text>    The first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword's bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC from it.</text>

        <text>     </text>
        <text>Curse: This sword is cursed and possessed by a vengeful spirit. Becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the sword, keeping it on your person at all times. While attuned to this weapon, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.</text>
        <text>    In addition, while the sword is on your person, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw whenever you take damage in combat. On a failed save you must attack the creature that damaged you until you drop to 0 hit points or it does, or until you can't reach the creature to make a melee attack against it.</text>
        <text>    You can break the curse in the usual ways. Alternatively, casting banishment on the sword forces the vengeful spirit to leave it. The sword then becomes a +1 weapon with no other properties.</text>

        <text>The double scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over tens of thousands of years, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double scimitar is an expensive weapon, but few people ever have an opportunity to purchase one. If you're an elf, your blade could have a long and storied history. If you're not an elf, you might have stolen the weapon from a fallen foe or received it from a dying Valenar ally. If you work with your DM to create the story behind your double scimitar, you can start with the weapon at 1st level in place of a martial weapon normally granted by your class. However, it can be dangerous for a non-elf to carry a double scimitar. Valenar may demand its return or challenge you to prove that you're worthy to wield it.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    Special: When you take the attack action and make a two-handed attack with a double-bladed scimitar, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the blade at the opposite end of the weapon. This attack uses the same ability modifier as the primary attack. The weapon's damage die for this attack is a d4, and it deals slashing damage.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    This magic weapon warns you of danger. While the weapon is on your person, you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, you and any of your companions within 30 feet of you can't be surprised, except when incapacitated by something other than nonmagical sleep. The weapon magically awakens you and your companions within range if any of you are sleeping naturally when combat begins.</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</text>

        <text>    Hit points lost to this weapon's damage can be regained only through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means.</text>
        <text>    Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you've wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.</text>

        <text>The double scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over tens of thousands of years, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double scimitar is an expensive weapon, but few people ever have an opportunity to purchase one. If you're an elf, your blade could have a long and storied history. If you're not an elf, you might have stolen the weapon from a fallen foe or received it from a dying Valenar ally. If you work with your DM to create the story behind your double scimitar, you can start with the weapon at 1st level in place of a martial weapon normally granted by your class. However, it can be dangerous for a non-elf to carry a double scimitar. Valenar may demand its return or challenge you to prove that you're worthy to wield it.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    Special: When you take the attack action and make a two-handed attack with a double-bladed scimitar, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the blade at the opposite end of the weapon. This attack uses the same ability modifier as the primary attack. The weapon's damage die for this attack is a d4, and it deals slashing damage.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</text>
        <text>    The sword has 1d8+1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</text>

        <text>    You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.</text>
        <text>    When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.</text>

        <text>These rings come in linked pairs. It you possess the Mark of Sentinel, you can use a bonus action to form a link to the creature attuned to the other ring; from then on, whenever that creature suffers damage, they only suffer half of that damage and you take the rest. This effect continues until you end it as a bonus action or until you or the other creature removes their ring. This effect isn't limited by range. A creature cannot be attuned to more than one ring of shared suffering.</text>

        <text>This is a sturdy leather sack with tiny Siberys shards embedded into the lining. If you have the Mark of Hospitality you can use an action to cast create food and water, drawing a feast from within the bag. You shape this meal with your thoughts. You can create the standard bland fare without requiring any sort of check, but you can attempt to create finer food by making a Charisma check; if you're proficient with cook's utensils, add your bonus to this check. A failed check results in a sour and squalid meal.</text>

        <text>A dimensional seal is a massive stone slab covered with a complex pattern of runes and sigils. The seal projects an invisible field with a radius of two miles. This field blocks all forms of conjuration magic and any other effect that involves teleportation or planar travel. It also negates the effects of any manifest zone within the field.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    Dimensional seals are usually found in the Eldeen Reaches and the Shadow Marches, as relics of the conflict between the Gatekeeper druids and the daelkyr. The techniques used to create these seals have been long lost. It's said that as a whole, the dimensional seals keep the daelkyr bound in Khyber and prevent Xoriat from becoming coterminous with Eberron. If enough of these seals are destroyed, there could be serious consequences for the world.</text>

        <detail>rare (requires attunement by a warforged)</detail>
        <weight></weight>
        <text>A docent is a small metal sphere, approximately 2 inches across, studded with dragonshards. Despite a strong magical aura, it has no obvious abilities. If you're a warforged, you can attune to the docent, at which point the sphere becomes embedded in your chest and comes to life &#8212; literally.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    A docent is an intelligent magic item designed to advise and assist the warforged it's attached to. A typical docent has an Intelligence score of 16 and Wisdom and Charisma scores of 14. Once you're attuned to the docent, it can communicate with you telepathically and can perceive the world through your senses. One of the simple functions of a docent is to serve as a translator. All docents understand Common and Giant, but a docent knows up to four additional languages. Elven and Draconic are common options. If a docent knows less than six languages in total, it can add new languages to its repertoire after encountering them. So a docent found in Xen'drik may have never encountered a dwarf before&#8230; but after spending some time in Khorvaire studying dwarves, it could pick up the Dwarven language.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    In addition, a docent possesses up to three of the following traits.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>&#8226;Can cast detect magic at will</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>&#8226;Can cast detect evil and good at will</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>&#8226;Can detect any form of divination or scrying targeting the warforged host.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>&#8226;Intelligence (Arcana) +7</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>&#8226;Intelligence (History) +7</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>&#8226;Intelligence (Investigation) +7</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>&#8226;Intelligence (Nature) +7</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>&#8226;Wisdom (Insight) +6</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>&#8226;Wisdom (Perception) +6</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    The docent can make Wisdom (Medicine) checks targeting its warforged host, with a +7 bonus. If the host is rendered unconscious, the docent will automatically attempt to stabilize them once each turn.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    You can use a bonus action on your turn to request that the docent use one of its traits on your behalf. In the case of skills, this uses the docent's bonus; your abilities and proficiencies have no effect on the outcome. These traits are under the control of the docent, and if you have a bad relationship with your docent it may refuse to assist you&#8230; or simply lie about information that it obtains. However, if you treat your docent well it could serve as a useful ally.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    The origin of docents is a great mystery. House Cannith created the first warforged thirty years ago. But the docents come from the distant land of Xen'drik and appear to be thousands of years old. Were they created to interface with some other form of construct? Or are the modern warforged a new interpretation of an ancient design? The docents claim to have forgotten their creators&#8230; but this is a mystery waiting to be unraveled. While all docents come from Xen'drik, some have been brought to Khorvaire by explorers and it's possible to encounter them in the Five Nations.</text>

        <text>Eberron dragonshards are found in shallow soil, and often encased in geode-like stone shells. Eberron shards can be found almost anywhere, but the most significant deposits have been discovered in jungle environments, notably Q'barra and the distant land of Xen'drik. In their raw form, Eberron shards are rosy crystals with crimson swirls flowing their depths.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    Eberron shards are the most common form of dragonshard. They are primarily refined into a glowing powder. This dragonshard dust can be used to fuel almost any act of magic. When casting a spell, you can use dragonshard dust in place of any spell component that has a cost, unless the DM says otherwise. Dragonshard dust is used in the creation of magic items, and many powerful tools &#8212; such as the lightning rail and elemental airships &#8212; require an ongoing expenditure of Eberron dragonshards to maintain their enchantments.</text>

        <text>    When you examine an object, you can make a Wisdom (Perception) check to identify the aura of the last living creature to touch the object. The DC is 13 + the number of days since the last contact occurred. If the check is successful, you learn the species of the creature and you can immediately use your Imprint Prey ability to target this creature.</text>

If you possess the Mark of Warding, when you cast alarm, arcane lock, glyph of warding, or similar abjuration effects, you can tie the effect to the keycharm. Whoever holds the keycharm is considered to the owner of this enchantment; they receive the notification from alarm, they can safely avoid a glyph, and they can deactivate any associated effect.</text>

            Khyber dragonshards are found deep in the earth, often near layers of magma. These living crystals typically grow on cavern walls, and superstition says they flourish in areas with significant fiendish activity. Khyber dragonshards are deep blue or dark violet, laced with gleaming veins.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    Khyber dragonshards have a affinity for binding magics. Elemental binding &#8212; which is behind airships, the lightning rail, and elemental galleons &#8212; requires a Khyber shard to hold the elemental. Khyber shards are used for phylacteries, planar binding, any other effects that trap or manipulate spirits. Khyber dragonshards are also used for many necromantic rituals.</text>

You can send a telepathic message of up to 25 words to the target. They must make a Wisdom saving throw, with a difficulty of 14 + your Intelligence modifier. On a failed save, the target is affected by a suggestion compelling them to follow your command. This effect doesn't require concentration; it lasts for eight hours, until you choose to end it, or until the victim successfully fulfils the command, whichever comes first. You can control up to eight warforged at once using this effect.</text>

Siberys dragonshards are amber in color, with swirling golding veins gleaming within.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    Siberys dragonshards have a close affinity to dragonmarks and are a vital part of any dragonmark focus item. Larger shards may be required for eldritch machines or used in the creation of legendary items or artifacts.</text>

        <text>This device creates an antimagic field that covers a three-mile radius around the spell sink. The form that it takes will depend on the nature of its creator. The Ashbound druids despise unnatural magic, and if they create a spell sink it will be a living artifact &#8212; a twisted tree that consumes the mystical energies around it. Conversely, a mad artificer would create a massive vessel of dragonshards and exotic metals. It might be that the sole purpose of the device is to negate magic, or it could be that it is absorbing all magical energies in the area and storing that power for a cataclysmic effect!</text>

        <text>A spellshard is a polished Eberron dragonshard, sized to fit into the palm of a hand. The shard is imbued with a particular work of literature. By holding the shard and concentrating, you can see its pages in your mind's eye. Thinking of a particular phrase or topic will draw you to the first section that addresses it, and a simple ritual allows you to add content to the shard.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    An arcane caster can use a spellshard instead of a spellbook; the spellshard costs 1 gp per &#8220;page&#8221; in the shard, and otherwise functions as a mundane spellbook. Spellshards can also be used as diaries or journals. More advanced (and uncommon) shards can require a particular mental passphrase to access the contents of the shard.</text>

        <text>A starburst crystal allows you to amplify the power of an offensive cantrip. Using the crystal requires a bonus action. If you immediately follow this by casting a cantrip that requires a ranged attack roll and targets a single individual &#8212; such as fire bolt or eldritch blast &#8212; the spell creates a burst of energy that fills a five foot area. You don't need to make an attack roll for the spell. Instead, your target makes a Dexterity saving throw. They suffer the full damage of the spell on a failed save, or half that damage if the save is successful.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    Once you've used this power, you cannot use it again until you take a short rest.</text>

        <text>This eldritch machine is a form of dragonmark focus item; you must have the Greater Mark of Storms to attune to this device. Storm spires allow House Lyrandar to influence the weather, which can be a boon for the local population or a curse if the Lyrandar baron chooses to demand payment for desired conditions. You gain the following benefits while you are attuned to a storm spire.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>&#8226;You can sense weather patterns within a 100-mile radius of the spire and accurately predict the weather for up to 24 hours.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>&#8226;While you are within 60 feet of the spire, you can use an action to cast any of the following spells: call lightning, gust of wind. You cast these as 5th level spells, and Intelligence is your spellcasting ability.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>&#8226;While you are within 5 feet of the spire, you can cast control weather as a ten-minute ritual. This allows you to pick a point within 100 miles of the spire and influence the weather within a 10-mile radius of that point. Maintaining this effect requires concentration.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>&#8226;You can also use an action to influence the weather within a ten-mile radius of the spire itself; you don't have to use concentration to maintain this effect, and you can sustain this at the same time that you're manipulating distant weather.</text>

        <text>A wand sheath is designed to integrate with the forearm of a warforged. If you're a warforged, you can attach a wand sheath by attuning to it. While the wand sheath is attached, it cannot be removed from you against your will. You can spend one minute to end the attunement and remove the wand sheath.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    You can insert a wand into the sheath as an action. While the wand is sheathed, you gain the following benefits</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    You can retract the wand into your forearm or extend it from your forearm as a bonus action. While it is retracted, it cannot be damaged or removed.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    While the wand is extended, you can use it as if you were holding it, but your hand remains free for other actions.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    If the sheathed wand requires attunement, you must attune to the wand before you can use it. However, the wand sheath and the attached wand only count as a single item for purposes of the maximum number of items you can be attuned to. If you remove the wand from the sheath, you immediately lose your attunement to the wand.</text>
