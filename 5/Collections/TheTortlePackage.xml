            <name>Claws</name>
            <text>Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</text>

        <trait>
            <name>Hold Breath</name>
            <text>You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour at a time. Tortles aren&#8217;t natural swimmers, but they can remain underwater for some time before needing to come up for air.</text>

        <trait>
            <name>Natural Armor</name>
            <text>Due to your shell and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your shell provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn&#8217;t affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield&#8217;s bonus as normal.</text>

        <trait>
            <name>Shell Defense</name>
            <text>You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, your speed is 0 and can&#8217;t increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can&#8217;t take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.</text>
