While you are playing it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the instrument and write a magical message on a nonmagical object or surface that you can see within 30 feet of you. The message can be up to six words long and is written in a language you know. If you are a bard, you can scribe an additional seven words and choose to make the message glow faintly, allowing it to be seen in nonmagical darkness. Casting dispel magic on the message erases it. Otherwise, the message fades away after 24 hours. The instrument regains all expended charges daily at dawn.</text>

                <text>Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger on in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When barbarians who follow this path rage, they cross the barrier into the spirit world and call on these guardian spirits for aid.</text>
                <text>    Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians fight to protect their tribes and their allies. With the spirits&#8217; help, they can hinder their foes even as they strike powerful blows against them. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors&#8217; deeds. These tattoos tell epic sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.</text>

The same magic that allows them to quell beasts can also bend minds. Villainous bards of this college can leech off a community for weeks, abusing their magic to turn their hosts into thralls.

Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats. But though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right.</text>
                <text>    Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. One blade might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail. Other blades strike at the wicked, bringing justice to bear against the cruel and powerful. Most troupes are happy to accept a blade&#8217;s talent for the excitement it adds to a performance, but few entertainers fully trust a blade in their ranks.</text>
                <text>    Blades who abandon lives as entertainers have often run into trouble that makes maintaining their secret activities impossible. A blade caught stealing or engaging in vigilante justice is too great a liability for most troupes. With their weapon skills and magic, these blades either take up work as enforcers for thieves&#8217; guilds or strike out on their own as adventurers.</text>

                <text>    Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge and power that will help them safeguard their charges better. Wherever these druids go, the spirits of the wilderness are with them.</text>

                <text>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to converse with beasts and many fey.</text>
                <text>    You learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan. In addition, beasts can understand your speech, and you gain the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability doesn&#8217;t grant you any special friendship with beasts, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.</text>

                <text>Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to call forth nature spirits to influence the world around you. As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit creates an aura in a 30-foot radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents.</text>
                <text>    As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 feet to a point you can see.</text>

                <text>    The effect of the spirit&#8217;s aura depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below.</text>

                <text>Bear Spirit: The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance. Each creature of your choice in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + your druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.</text>
                <text>     </text>
                <text>Hawk Spirit: The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit&#8217;s aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.</text>
                <text>     </text>
                <text>Unicorn Spirit: The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit&#8217;s aura. In addition, if you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores hit points to any creature inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level.</text>

                <text>The Oath of Conquest calls to paladins who seek glory in battle and the subjugation of their enemies. It isn&#8217;t enough for these paladins to establish order. They must crush the forces of chaos. Sometimes called knight tyrants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather into grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war and well-ordered might.</text>
                <text>    Some of these paladins go so far as to consort with the powers of the Nine Hells, valuing the rule of law over the balm of mercy. The archdevil Bel, warlord of Avernus, counts many of these paladins&#8212;called hell knights&#8212;as his most ardent supporters. Hell knights cover their armor with trophies taken from fallen enemies, a grim warning to any who dare oppose them and the decrees of their lords. These knights are often most fiercely resisted by other paladins of this oath, who believe that the hell knights have wandered too far into darkness.</text>

                <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Redemption</name>
                <text>The Oath of Redemption sets a paladin on a difficult path, one that requires a holy warrior to use violence only as a last resort. Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk. These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning their foes to the light, and they slay their enemies only when such a deed will clearly save other lives. Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers.</text>
                <text>    While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Redeemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil. Against such foes, paladins who swear this oath bring the full wrath of their weapons and spells to bear. Yet the redeemers still pray that, one day, even creatures of wickedness will invite their own redemption.</text>

                <text>     </text>
                <text>Peace: Violence is a weapon of last resort. Diplomacy and understanding are the paths to long-lasting peace.</text>
                <text>     </text>
                <text>Innocence: All people begin life in an innocent state, and it is their environment or the influence of dark forces that drives them to evil. By setting the proper example, and working to heal the wounds of a deeply flawed world, you can set anyone on a righteous path.</text>
                <text>     </text>
                <text>Patience: Change takes time. Those who have walked the path of the wicked must be given reminders to keep them honest and true. Once you have planted the seed of righteousness in a creature, you must work day after day to allow it to survive and then flourish.</text>
                <text>     </text>
                <text>Wisdom: Your heart and mind must stay clear, for eventually you will be forced to admit defeat. While every creature can be redeemed, some are so far along the path of evil that you have no choice but to end their lives for the greater good. Any such action must be carefully weighed and the consequences fully understood, but once you have made the decision, follow through with it knowing your path is just.</text>

Perhaps your ancestor was an angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to fight in a god&#8217;s name. Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic.</text>
                <text>    A Divine Soul, with a natural magnetism, is seen as a threat to some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who commands sacred power, a Divine Soul can undermine an existing order by claiming a direct tie to the divine.</text>

                <text>    In addition, choose an affinity for the source of your divine power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You learn an additional spell based on that affinity, as shown below. It is a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.</text>

                <text>You have made your pact with a mysterious entity from the Shadowfell&#8212;a force that manifests in sentient magic weapons carved from the stuff of shadow. The mighty sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these weapons, several of which have spread across the multiverse over the ages. The shadowy force behind these weapons can offer power to warlocks who form pacts with it. Many hexblade warlocks create weapons that emulate those formed in the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, content to weave the dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting.</text>
                <text>    Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the first of these weapons, many sages speculate that she and the force are one and that the weapons, along with hexblade warlocks, are tools she uses to manipulate events on the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends.</text>

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property.

                <text>A variety of arcane colleges specialize in training wizards for war. The tradition of War Magic blends principles of evocation and abjuration, rather than specializing in either of those schools. It teaches techniques that empower a caster&#8217;s spells, while also providing methods for a wizard to bolster their own defenses.</text>
                <text>    Followers of this tradition are known as war mages. They see their magic as both a weapon and armor, a resource superior to any flimsy piece of steel. War mages act fast in battle, using their spells to seize tactical control of a situation. Their spells strike hard, while their defensive skills foil their opponents&#8217; attempts to counterattack. War mages are also adept at turning other spellcasters&#8217; magical energy against them.</text>
                <text>    In great battles, a war mage often works with evokers, abjurers, and other types of wizards. Evokers, in particular, sometimes tease war mages for splitting their attention between offense and defense.

Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target the ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10-foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared.

        <text>    If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature&#8217;s choice) against the spell&#8217;s save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.</text>

If the wind is strong, any creature moving against the wind must spend 1 extra foot of movement for each foot moved.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    Downdraft: You cause a sustained blast of strong wind to blow downward from the top of the cube. Ranged weapon attacks that pass through the cube or that are made against targets within it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. A creature must make a Strength saving throw if it flies into the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there flying. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    Updraft: You cause a sustained updraft within the cube, rising upward from the cube&#8217;s bottom side. Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from the fall. When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can jump up to 10 feet higher than normal.</text>

        <text>    </text>
        <text>&#8226; An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</text>

        <text>    The statistics of the homunculus are in the Monster Manual. It is your faithful companion, and it dies if you die. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can spend up to half your Hit Dice if the homunculus is on the same plane of existence as you. When you do so, roll each die and add your Constitution modifier to it. Your hit point maximum is reduced by the total, and the homunculus&#8217;s hit point maximum and current hit points are both increased by it. This process can reduce you to no lower than 1 hit point, and the change to your and the homunculus&#8217;s hit points ends when you finish your next long rest. The reduction to your hit point maximum can&#8217;t be removed by any means before then, except by the homunculus&#8217;s death.</text>

        <text>    You can have only one homunculus at a time. If you cast this spell while your homunculus lives, the spell fails.</text>

        <text>    You invoke the spirits of nature to protect an area outdoors or underground. The area can be as small as a 30-foot cube or as large as a 90-foot cube. Buildings and other structures are excluded from the affected area. If you cast this spell in the same area every day for a year, the spell lasts until dispelled.</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>    The spell creates the following effects within the area. When you cast this spell, you can specify creatures as friends who are immune to the effects. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>    The entire warded area radiates magic. A dispel magic cast on the area, if successful, removes only one of the following effects, not the entire area. That spell&#8217;s caster chooses which effect to end. Only when all its effects are gone is this spell dispelled.</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>    Solid Fog. You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground with thick fog, making them heavily obscured. The fog reaches 10 feet high. In addition, every foot of movement through the fog costs 2 extra feet. To a creature immune to this effect, the fog obscures nothing and looks like soft mist, with motes of green light floating in the air.</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>    Grasping Undergrowth. You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground that aren&#8217;t filled with fog with grasping weeds and vines, as if they were affected by an entangle spell. To a creature immune to this effect, the weeds and vines feel soft and reshape themselves to serve as temporary seats or beds.</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>    Grove Guardians. You can animate up to four trees in the area, causing them to uproot themselves from the ground. These trees have the same statistics as an awakened tree, which appears in the Monster Manual, except they can&#8217;t speak, and their bark is covered with druidic symbols. If any creature not immune to this effect enters the warded area, the grove guardians fight until they have driven off or slain the intruders. The grove guardians also obey your spoken commands (no action required by you) that you issue while in the area. If you don&#8217;t give them commands and no intruders are present, the grove guardians do nothing. The grove guardians can&#8217;t leave the warded area. When the spell ends, the magic animating them disappears, and the trees take root again if possible.</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>    Additional Spell Effect. You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area:</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>    A constant gust of wind in two locations of your choice</text>
        <text>    Spike growth in one location of your choice</text>
        <text>    Wind wall in two locations of your choice</text>
        <text>    To a creature immune to this effect, the winds are a fragrant, gentle breeze, and the area of spike growth is harmless.</text>

        <text>    As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 60 feet.

When you create the dragon, choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, or poison. Each creature in the cone must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking 7d6 damage of the chosen damage type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    The illusion is tangible because of the shadow stuff used to create it, but attacks miss it automatically, it succeeds on all saving throws, and it is immune to all damage and conditions. A creature that uses an action to examine the dragon can determine that it is an illusion by succeeding on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through it and has advantage on saving throws against its breath.</text>

You might cause the target to perceive itself as being surrounded by fire, floating razors, or hideous maws filled with dripping teeth. Whatever form the illusion takes, the target can&#8217;t see or hear anything beyond it and is restrained for the spell&#8217;s duration. If the target is moved out of the illusion, makes a melee attack through it, or reaches any part of its body through it, the target takes 10d10 psychic damage, and the spell ends.</text>

        <text>A fortress of stone erupts from a square area of ground of your choice that you can see within range. The area is 120 feet on each side, and it must not have any buildings or other structures on it. Any creatures in the area are harmlessly lifted up as the fortress rises.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    The fortress has four turrets with square bases, each one 20 feet on a side and 30 feet tall, with one turret on each corner. The turrets are connected to each other by stone walls that are each 80 feet long, creating an enclosed area. Each wall is 1 foot thick and is composed of panels that are 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall. Each panel is contiguous with two other panels or one other panel and a turret. You can place up to four stone doors in the fortress&#8217;s outer wall.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    A small keep stands inside the enclosed area. The keep has a square base that is 50 feet on each side, and it has three floors with 10-foot-high ceilings. Each of the floors can be divided into as many rooms as you like, provided each room is at least 5 feet on each side. The floors of the keep are connected by stone staircases, its walls are 6 inches thick, and interior rooms can have stone doors or open archways as you choose. The keep is furnished and decorated however you like, and it contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people each day. Furnishings, food, and other objects created by this spell crumble to dust if removed from the fortress.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    A staff of one hundred invisible servants obeys any command given to them by creatures you designate when you cast the spell. Each servant functions as if created by the unseen servant spell.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    The walls, turrets, and keep are all made of stone that can be damaged. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of stone has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. It is immune to poison and psychic damage. Reducing a section of stone to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected sections to buckle and collapse at the DM&#8217;s discretion.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    After 7 days or when you cast this spell somewhere else, the fortress harmlessly crumbles and sinks back into the ground, leaving any creatures that were inside it safely on the ground.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    Casting this spell on the same spot once every 7 days for a year makes the fortress permanent.</text>

        <text>&#8226; If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour.</text>

Unless the target is undead, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target killed by this damage rises up as a zombie at the start of your next turn. The zombie pursues whatever creature it can see that is closest to it.

Finally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    A target suffering this pain can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the pain ends.</text>

The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    Borrow Experience: You can use a bonus action to bolster yourself with the soul&#8217;s life experience, making your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage. If you don&#8217;t use this benefit before the start of your next turn, it is lost.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    Eyes of the Dead: You can use an action to name a place the humanoid saw in life, which creates an invisible sensor somewhere in that place if it is on the plane of existence you&#8217;re currently on. The sensor remains for as long as you concentrate, up to 10 minutes (as if you were concentrating on a spell). You receive visual and auditory information from the sensor as if you were in its space using your senses.</text>

        <text>    Roll initiative for the demon, which has its own turns.

On a successful save, your control of the demon ends for the rest of the duration, and the demon spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest non-demons to the best of its ability.

        <text>You cause a temple to shimmer into existence on ground you can see within range. The temple must fit within an unoccupied cube of space, up to 120 feet on each side. The temple remains until the spell ends. It is dedicated to whatever god, pantheon, or philosophy is represented by the holy symbol used in the casting.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    You make all decisions about the temple&#8217;s appearance. The interior is enclosed by a floor, walls, and a roof, with one door granting access to the interior and as many windows as you wish. Only you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open or close the door.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    The temple&#8217;s interior is an open space with an idol or altar at one end. You decide whether the temple is illuminated and whether that illumination is bright light or dim light. The smell of burning incense fills the air within, and the temperature is mild.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    The temple opposes types of creatures you choose when you cast this spell. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If a creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, that creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it can&#8217;t enter the temple for 24 hours. Even if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there hinders it; whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw inside the temple, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    In addition, the sensors created by divination spells can&#8217;t appear inside the temple, and creatures within can&#8217;t be targeted by divination spells.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    Finally, whenever any creature in the temple regains hit points from a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 hit point).</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    The temple is made from opaque magical force that extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temple&#8217;s interior. Nothing can physically pass through the temple&#8217;s exterior. It can&#8217;t be dispelled by dispel magic, and antimagic field has no effect on it.

        <text>You endow yourself with endurance and martial prowess fueled by magic. Until the spell ends, you can&#8217;t cast spells, and you gain the following benefits:</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>&#8226; You gain 50 temporary hit points. If any of these remain when the spell ends, they are lost.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>&#8226; You have advantage on attack rolls that you make with simple and martial weapons.</text>
        <text>     </text>

        <text>     </text>
        <text>&#8226; You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    Immediately after the spell ends, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion.</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>Exhaustion:</text>
        <text>    Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>Level &#8212; Effect:</text>
        <text>1 &#8212;Disadvantage on ability checks</text>
        <text>2 &#8212;Speed halved</text>
        <text>3 &#8212;Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</text>
        <text>4 &#8212;Hit point maximum halved</text>
        <text>5 &#8212;Speed reduced to 0</text>
        <text>    6 &#8212;Death</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</text>
        <text>    A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</text>
        <text>    An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</text>
        <text>    Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</text>

        <text>     </text>
        <text>    As a bonus action, you can mentally command the creature if it is within 120 feet of you. (If you control multiple creatures with this spell, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a simple, general command, such as to fetch a key, stand watch, or stack some books. If you issue no commands, the servant does nothing other than defend itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the servant continues to follow that order until its task is complete.</text>

        <text>    Transmute Rock to Mud: Nonmagical rock of any sort in the area becomes an equal volume of thick, flowing mud that remains for the spell&#8217;s duration.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    The ground in the spell&#8217;s area becomes muddy enough that creatures can sink into it. Each foot that a creature moves through the mud costs 4 feet of movement, and any creature on the ground when you cast the spell must make a Strength saving throw. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. On a failed save, a creature sinks into the mud and is restrained, though it can use an action to end the restrained condition on itself by pulling itself free of the mud.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    If you cast the spell on a ceiling, the mud falls. Any creature under the mud when it falls must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    Transmute Mud to Rock: Nonmagical mud or quicksand in the area no more than 10 feet deep transforms into soft stone for the spell&#8217;s duration. Any creature in the mud when it transforms must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is shunted safely to the surface in an unoccupied space. On a failed save, a creature becomes restrained by the rock. A restrained creature, or another creature within reach, can use an action to try to break the rock by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or by dealing damage to it. The rock has AC 15 and 25 hit points, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>Restrained:</text>
        <text>&#8226; A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.</text>

        <text>    Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall&#8217;s space has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target.

Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall&#8217;s water doesn&#8217;t fill it.</text>

        <text>You conjure up a sphere of water with a 5-foot radius at a point you can see within range. The sphere can hover but no more than 10 feet off the ground. The sphere remains for the spell&#8217;s duration.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    Any creature in the sphere&#8217;s space must make a Strength saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied space of the creature&#8217;s choice outside the sphere. A Huge or larger creature succeeds on the saving throw automatically, and a Large or smaller creature can choose to fail it. On a failed save, a creature is restrained by the sphere and is engulfed by the water. At the end of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    The sphere can restrain as many as four Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature. If the sphere restrains a creature that causes it to exceed this capacity, a random creature that was already restrained by the sphere falls out of it and lands prone in a space within 5 feet of it.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in a straight line. If it moves over a pit, a cliff, or other drop-off, it safely descends until it is hovering 10 feet above the ground. Any creature restrained by the sphere moves with it. You can ram the sphere into creatures, forcing them to make the saving throw.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all normal flames within 30 feet of it. Any creature restrained by the sphere is knocked prone in the space where it falls. The water then vanishes.</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>Prone:</text>
        <text>&#8226; A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.</text>

        <text>&#8226; The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>&#8226; An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</text>

        <text>&#8226; A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.</text>

        <text>A whirlwind howls down to a point that you can see on the ground within range. The whirlwind is a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Until the spell ends, you can use your action to move the whirlwind up to 30 feet in any direction along the ground. The whirlwind sucks up any Medium or smaller objects that aren&#8217;t secured to anything and that aren&#8217;t worn or carried by anyone.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw the first time on a turn that it enters the whirlwind or that the whirlwind enters its space, including when the whirlwind first appears. A creature takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained in the whirlwind until the spell ends. When a creature starts its turn restrained by the whirlwind, the creature is pulled 5 feet higher inside it, unless the creature is at the top. A restrained creature moves with the whirlwind and falls when the spell ends, unless the creature has some means to stay aloft.</text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>    A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against your spell save DC. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlwind and is hurled 3d6 _ 10 feet away from it in a random direction.</text>

        <text>    Roots and Vines: At the end of each of your turns, one creature of your choice that is on the ground in the cube must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained until the spell ends.

        <text>    Rock:. As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause a loose rock in the cube to launch at a creature you can see in the cube. Make a ranged spell attack against the target.
