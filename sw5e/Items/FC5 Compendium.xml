                    When you use your Reckless Attack feature, you can choose to not have advantage on your attack rolls
                    this turn. If you do so, friendly creatures within 5 feet of a hostile creature that is within 5

                    When you are forced to make a saving throw against a force power, you can immediately use your
                    reaction to move up to half your speed towards the source power’s caster. If you end this movement
                    within 5 feet of the target, you can immediately make one melee weapon attack against the target as
                    a part of that reaction.

                    VARACTYL’S INSTINCT
                    Prerequisite: 13th level

                    general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.

                    TECH POWERS KNOWN
                    You learn 3 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech
                    Powers Known column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting table. You may not learn a tech power of
                    a level higher than your Max Power Level.

                    TECH POINTS
                    You have a number of tech points equal to half of your berserker level (rounded up), as shown in the
                    Tech Points column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You
                    use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a
                    short or long rest.

                    MAX POWER LEVEL
                    Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can
                    overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max
                    Power Level column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting table.

                    You may only cast tech powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

                    TECHCASTING ABILITY
                    Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a
                    power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when
                    setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

                    Tech save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

                    Tech attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

                    TECHCASTING FOCUS
                    You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5 of the Player’s Handbook) as a tech focus for your tech

                    FORCE POWERS KNOWN
                    You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force
                    Powers Known column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of
                    a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn
                    its prerequisite.

                    FORCE POINTS
                    You have a number of force points equal to your berserker level, as shown in the Force Points column
                    of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You
                    use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a
                    long rest.

                    MAX POWER LEVEL
                    Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You
                    can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the
                    Max Power Level column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table.

                    You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

                    FORCECASTING ABILITY
                    Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use Wisdom for
                    light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your
                    choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability.
                    Additionally, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power
                    you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

                    Force save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier

                    Force attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier

                <text>In your meditations on the force, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you
                    with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11
                    for the force powers list.

                    FORCE POWERS KNOWN
                    You learn 9 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force
                    Powers Known column of the consular table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than
                    your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

                    FORCE POINTS
                    You have a number of force points equal to your consular level x 4, as shown in the Force Points
                    column of the consular table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force
                    points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

                    MAX POWER LEVEL
                    Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You
                    can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the
                    Max Power Level column of the consular table.

                    You may only cast force powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability to do so
                    after a long rest.

                    FORCECASTING ABILITY
                    Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use Wisdom for
                    light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your
                    choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability.
                    Additionally, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power
                    you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

                    Force save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier

                    Force attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier

                <text>CAREFUL POWER
                    When you cast a power that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of
                    those creatures from the power’s full force. To do so, you spend 1 additional force point and choose
                    a number of those creatures up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). A
                    chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the power.

                    DISTANT POWER
                    When you cast a power that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 additional force point
                    to double the range of the power.

                    Alternatively, when you cast a power that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 additional force
                    point to make the range of the power 30 feet.

                    EXTENDED POWER
                    When you cast a power that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 additional force
                    point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

                    HEIGHTENED POWER
                    When you cast a power that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can
                    spend 3 additional force points to give one target of the power disadvantage on its first saving
                    throw made against the power.

                    IMPROVED POWER
                    When you roll damage for a power, you can spend 1 additional force point to reroll a number of the
                    damage dice up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). You must use the
                    new rolls.

                    You can use Improved Power even if you have already used a different Force-Empowered Casting option
                    during the casting of the power.

                    LINGERING POWER
                    When you cast a power that requires concentration to maintain you can choose to spend 3 additional
                    force points. If you do, when you lose concentration on the power, the power will not end until the
                    end of your next turn.

                    PINPOINT POWER
                    When you cast a power that allows you to force creatures in an area to make a saving throw you can
                    instead spend 1 force point and make a ranged force attack against a single target that would be in
                    the range. On a hit the target suffers the effects as though they failed their saving throw.

                    QUICKENED POWER
                    When you cast a power that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 additional force points
                    to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

                    REFOCUSED POWER
                    When you are forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a power you can
                    use your reaction and spend 2 force points to automatically succeed on the saving throw.

                    You can use Refocused Power even if you have already used a different Force-Empowered Casting option
                    during the casting of the power.

                    SEEKING POWER
                    If you miss with a force power that calls for an attack roll, you can spend 2 force points to reroll
                    the attack. You must use the new roll.

                    You can use Seeking Power even if you have already used a different Force-Empowered Casting option
                    during the casting of the power.

                    TWINNED POWER
                    When you cast a power that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend
                    a number of additional force points equal to the power’s level to target a second creature in range
                    with the same power (1 force point if the power is at-will).

                    twice your consular level + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice).

                    Whenever you take damage, the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier
                    to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

                    move up to 10 feet and make a melee force attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit,
                    the target takes 1d8 + your forcecasting ability modifier damage. The type is of the normal damage
                    dealt by the weapon. The weapon then returns to your side.

                    Your weapon moves with you, and while Saber Storm is active and you have a weapon animated, on each

                    attack with your weapons, you can direct them at the same target or at different ones. Make a
                    separate attack roll for each weapon.

                    At 5th level, the distance your weapon can travel increases to 20 feet. This distance increases to
                    30 feet at 11th level, and 40 feet at 17th level.

                <text>You’ve taken an apprentice, gaining the services of your own humanoid companion.

                    Create your humanoid companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options
                    document for Expanded Content.

                    If your companion dies, or you want to bond with a different one, you must first break the bond with
                    your current companion. Bonding with a new companion takes 8 hours spent in an appropriate location.
                    You may only have one companion at a time.

                    In addition to its traits and features, your companion gains additional benefits while it is bonded
                    to you:

                    Your companion gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th
                    level in this class. For each trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your force point maximum is
                    reduced by 2.
                    Lastly, while bonded and within 10 feet of you, when your companion is hit by an attack, you can use
                    your reaction and expend a use of your Force Shield feature to shroud it in Force energy. If you do
                    so, until the start of your next turn, both you and your companion gain the benefits of your Force
                    Shield. This includes the triggering attack.

                    At 11th level, your companion must be within 30 feet of you to benefit from this feature. At 17th
                    level, your companion must be within 60 feet.

                <name>Forcecasting</name>
                <text>In your meditations on the Force, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you
                    with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11
                    for the force powers list.

                    FORCE POWERS KNOWN
                    You learn 5 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force
                    Powers Known column of the guardian table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than
                    your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

                    FORCE POINTS
                    You have a number of force points equal to your guardian level x 2, as shown in the Force Points
                    column of the guardian table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force
                    points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

                    MAX POWER LEVEL
                    Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You
                    can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the
                    Max Power Level column of the guardian table.

                    You may only cast force powers at 5th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

                    FORCECASTING ABILITY
                    Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use Wisdom for
                    light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your
                    choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability.
                    Additionally, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power
                    you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

                    Force save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier

                    Force attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier
                </text>
            </feature>
            <feature>
                <name>Channel the Force</name>
                <text>You know how to channel the Force to create a unique effect. You start with your choice of one
                    from two such effects: Cause Harm or Lend Aid. At 3rd level, your Guardian Focus grants you an
                    additional effect. When you use your Channel the Force, you choose which effect to create.

                    Some Channel the Force effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class,
                    the DC equals your universal force save DC.

                    You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice,
                    minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

                    CAUSE HARM
                    As an action, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to sap the life from a hostile creature
                    you can see within 60 feet. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
                    the creature takes necrotic damage equal to your guardian level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of
                    one), or half as much on a successful one.

                    LEND AID
                    As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force and touch a beast or humanoid
                    within 5 feet of you. That creature regains hit points equal to your guardian level + your Wisdom
                    modifier (minimum of one). Alternatively, if the beast or humanoid is poisoned or diseased, you
                    neutralize the poison or disease. If more than one poison or disease afflicts the target, you
                    neutralize one poison or disease that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.

                    damage to the target, which is the same type as the weapon’s damage. The additional damage is 1d8
                    for each point spent in this way. You can’t deal more additional damage than the amount shown in the
                    Focused Strikes column of the guardian table.

                <text>Akimbo Style PHB
                    You are skilled at fighting with two blasters. While you are wielding separate weapons in each hand
                    with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:

                    When you engage in Two-Weapon Fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage roll of your
                    Two-Weapon Fighting attack as long as it doesn’t already include that modifier.
                    Reloading a weapon no longer requires a free hand.


                    Berserk Style PHB
                    You are skilled at returning pain to those who deliver it. You gain the following benefits:

                    When you hit with a melee weapon attack using Strength, you deal additional damage equal to your
                    Strength modifier if that creature dealt damage to you since the start of your last turn.
                    When you choose to let an attack that would miss you hit you instead, the creature rolls the damage
                    as normal instead of choosing the maximum.


                    Brawler Style PHB
                    You are skilled at using your weight to your advantage. You gain the following benefits:
                    You are proficient with improvised weapons.
                    Your damage die for your unarmed strikes and natural weapons increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4
                    to d6, or d6 to d8).
                    When you take the Attack action and attempt to grapple, shove, or trip a creature, or make an attack
                    against a creature with an unarmed strike or a weapon wielded in one hand on your turn, you can use
                    your bonus action to make an unarmed strike, grapple, shove, or trip against the same creature.


                    Covert Style PHB
                    You are skilled at fighting from unseen angles. You gain the following benefits:

                    You can take the Hide action as a bonus action. If you could already take the Hide action as a bonus
                    action, you can instead take it as a reaction on your turn.
                    Creatures you’ve dealt damage to since the start of your last turn have disadvantage on Wisdom
                    (Perception) checks made to find you.


                    Defense Style PHB
                    You are skilled at the art of defending yourself. While you are wearing medium or heavy armor with
                    which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:

                    You can use your bonus action to mark a target within 30 feet that you can see until the end of your
                    next turn. When you do so, damage dealt to you by the target is reduced by an amount equal to half
                    your Strength or Constitution modifier (your choice, rounded up, minimum of 1) while marked. You can
                    only have one creature marked in this way at a time.
                    You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws to avoid being moved.


                    Disruption Style PHB
                    Choose one from force- or tech-casting. You are skilled at fighting and interfering with casters of
                    the chosen type. You gain the following benefits:

                    When you force a creature to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on your
                    turn, and they succeed on the save, you can use your bonus action to force them to reroll the save.
                    They must use the new roll.
                    Once per round, when a hostile creature attempts to cast a power while within 5 feet of you, they
                    must first make a Constitution saving throw as if to maintain concentration (DC = 10 + the power’s
                    level). On a failure, the power isn’t cast and any points are wasted.


                    Dual Wield Style PHB
                    You are skilled at fighting with two weapons. While you are wielding separate weapons in each hand
                    with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:

                    When you engage in Two-Weapon Fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage roll of your
                    Two-Weapon Fighting attack as long as it doesn’t already include that modifier.
                    When you make an opportunity attack, you can attack with both of your weapons.


                    Duelist Style PHB
                    You are skilled in the art of fighting with a single weapon. While you are wielding a weapon in one
                    hand with which you are proficient and no other weapons, you gain the following benefits:
                    You can use your bonus action to feint. If you do so, you must make a Charisma (Deception) check
                    contested by the target’s Wisdom (Insight) check. On a success, you have advantage on the first
                    attack roll you make against them before the start of your next turn.
                    When you miss with a weapon attack on your turn, you can use your bonus action to repeat the attack
                    against the same target. Any modifications to the original attack roll, such as advantage,
                    disadvantage, or without your proficiency bonus, also affect this attack roll.
                    Once on each of your turns, drawing or stowing a one-handed weapon no longer requires your object
                    interaction.


                    Equilibrium Style PHB
                    You are skilled at fighting without the confines of armor. While you are wearing light or no armor
                    and not wielding a shield, you gain the following benefits:
                    You can use your bonus action to mark a target within 30 feet that you can see until the end of your
                    next turn. When you do so, you gain a bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws against effects the
                    target controls equal to half your Dexterity modifier (rounded up, minimum of +1) while marked. You
                    can only have one creature marked in this way at a time.
                    You have advantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws to avoid being moved.


                    Explosives Style PHB
                    You are skilled at fighting with explosives. You gain the following benefits:
                    You can throw grenades with your bonus action, instead of your action. If you could already throw
                    grenades as a bonus action, you can instead do so as a reaction on your turn.
                    When a creature rolls a 1 on the saving throw against an ammunition or explosive you control, they
                    treat the effect’s damage as if it had rolled the maximum.


                    Formation Style PHB
                    You are skilled at fighting with a partner. While an ally is within 5 feet of you, you gain the
                    following benefits:
                    You can take the Guard action as a bonus action. If you could already take the Guard action as a
                    bonus action, you can instead take it as a reaction on your turn.
                    When you move on your turn, you can use a bonus action to allow a willing ally within 5 feet of you
                    to move with you (no action required by the ally). The ally must end this movement within 5 feet of
                    you, and this movement can’t exceed the ally’s speed.
                    When you choose to let an attack that would hit a guarded ally hit you instead, the creature rolls
                    the damage as normal instead of choosing the maximum.


                    Formfighting Style PHB
                    Prerequisite: The ability to cast force powers
                    You are skilled at the basics of the known forms of lightsaber combat. You gain the following
                    benefits:
                    You learn three lightsaber forms, detailed later in this chapter. (They will be in a list in Feats.)
                    Once on each of your turns, you can draw or stow a lightweapon without using your object
                    interaction.


                    Great Weapon Style PHB
                    You are skilled at putting the weight of a weapon to your advantage. While you are wielding a light-
                    or vibro-weapon with the two-handed property with which you are proficient, you gain the following
                    benefits:
                    When you roll a 1 or 2 on a weapon damage die, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll,
                    even if the new roll is a 1 or 2.
                    Grasping a two-handed weapon you are wielding in only one hand with your other hand no longer
                    requires your object interaction.


                    Guerrilla Style PHB
                    You are skilled at maneuvering across the battlefield. You gain the following benefits:
                    You can take the Disengage action as a bonus action. If you could already take the Disengage action
                    as a bonus action, you can instead take it as a reaction on your turn.
                    When you take the Disengage action, you ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and you have advantage
                    on the first ability check or saving throw to avoid an effect that impairs your movement speed or
                    forces you to move before the start of your next turn.


                    Gunning Style PHB
                    You are skilled at using blasters in unique ways. While you are wielding a blaster weapon with which
                    you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:

                    When a creature rolls a 1 on the saving throw against the burst or rapid property, or a specialized
                    power cell or slug cartridge, that you control, they treat the effect’s damage as if it had rolled
                    the maximum.
                    When you use the burst property of a weapon, you can instead spray a line 20 feet long and 5 feet
                    wide within range with shots.
                    When you use the rapid property of a weapon, when you roll the weapon’s damage dice twice, you can
                    double one set of the weapon’s damage dice and forgo the other instead of adding them together.


                    Mounted Style PHB
                    You are skilled at fighting while mounted. You gain the following benefits:
                    Mounting a vehicle or beast only uses 5 feet of your movement, provided you can reach it.
                    You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead, provided you are a valid
                    target for that attack.


                    Onslaught Style PHB
                    You are skilled at using your momentum to your advantage. You gain the following benefits:
                    You can take the Dash action as a bonus action. If you could already take the Dash action as a bonus
                    action, you can instead take it as a reaction on your turn.
                    When you attempt to trip a creature, instead of making a Strength (Athletics) check, you can instead
                    make a melee weapon attack roll. If you are wielding your weapon in two hands, you make this attack
                    roll with advantage.


                    Sentinel Style PHB
                    You are skilled at techniques that take advantage of every drop in any enemy’s guard. While you are
                    wielding a light- or vibro-weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
                    Creatures provoke an opportunity attack when they move to within your reach or move 5 feet or
                    greater while within your reach.
                    When you hit a creature that is no more than one size larger than you with an opportunity attack,
                    the creature gains 4 slowed levels until the end of the current turn.


                    Sharpshooter Style PHB
                    You are skilled with blaster weapons and can make shots that others find difficult. While you are
                    wielding a blaster weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
                    You can use your bonus action to mark a target 30 feet or greater from you. If you do so, and that
                    target moves at least 5 feet before the start of your next turn, they provoke an opportunity attack
                    from you, and you can use a blaster weapon for that opportunity attack.
                    Your ranged weapon attacks ignore one-quarter and half cover against targets 30 feet or greater from
                    you.

                    property in the other hand.
                    You can use a bonus action to try to shove or trip a creature within 5 feet of you with your shield.
                    When you use a shield as an improvised weapon, you are considered proficient in it.


                    Snapshot Style PHB
                    You are skilled at getting up close and personal with blaster weapons. While you are wielding a
                    blaster weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:

                    have disadvantage on the attack roll.
                    Your ranged weapon attacks ignore one-quarter and half cover against targets within 30 feet of you.
                    When you roll a 1 on a blaster weapon damage die against a creature within 30 feet, you can reroll
                    the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1.
                    Grasping a two-handed weapon you are wielding in only one hand with your other hand no longer

                    thrown property with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
                    Whenever you make a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, you can immediately draw another weapon as
                    part of the attack.
                    Whenever you make a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, you can move up to 5 feet.
                    When you miss with a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, you can use your bonus action to repeat the
                    attack against a creature within 15 feet and behind your initial target. Any modifications to the
                    original attack roll, such as advantage, disadvantage, or without your proficiency bonus, also
                    affect this attack roll.


                    Twin-Blade Style PHB
                    You are skilled at fighting with double-bladed weapons. While you are wielding a weapon with the
                    double property with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
                    When you engage in Double-Weapon Fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the attack roll of
                    your Double-Weapon Fighting attack.
                    When you attempt to shove a creature, instead of making a Strength (Athletics) check, you can
                    instead make an attack roll. If you are wielding your weapon in two hands, you make this attack roll
                    with advantage.


                    Versatile Style PHB
                    You are skilled at using weapons in different ways. While you are wielding a melee weapon with the
                    versatile property with which you are proficient and no other weapons, you gain the following
                    benefits:
                    When you miss with a melee weapon attack on your turn while wielding a weapon in two hands, you can
                    use your bonus action to repeat the attack roll against the same target using one hand. Any
                    modifications to the original attack roll, such as advantage, disadvantage, or without your
                    proficiency bonus, also affect this attack roll.
                    When you miss with a melee weapon attack on your turn while wielding a weapon in one hand, you can
                    use your bonus action to attempt to shove or trip that creature. Any modifications to the original
                    attack roll, such as advantage, disadvantage, or without your proficiency bonus, also affect this
                    ability check.
                    Grasping a versatile weapon you are wielding in only one hand with your other hand no longer
                    requires your object interaction.

                    can expend a use of your Channel the Force and expend force points to deal additional damage to the
                    target, which is the same type as the power’s damage. The additional damage is 1d8 for each point
                    spent in this way. You can’t deal more additional damage than the amount shown in the Focused
                    Strikes column of the guardian table.

                <name>Forcecasting</name>
                <text>In your meditations on the force, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you
                    with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11
                    for the force powers list.

                    FORCE POWERS KNOWN
                    You learn 7 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force
                    Powers Known column of the sentinel table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than
                    your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

                    FORCE POINTS
                    You have a number of force points equal to your sentinel level x 3, as shown in the Force Points
                    column of the sentinel table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force
                    points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

                    MAX POWER LEVEL
                    Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You
                    can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the
                    Max Power Level column of the sentinel table.

                    You may only cast force powers at 5th, 6th, and 7th-level once. You regain the ability to do so
                    after a long rest.

                    FORCECASTING ABILITY
                    Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use Wisdom for
                    light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your
                    choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability.
                    Additionally, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power
                    you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

                    Force save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier

                    Force attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier

                    you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 force point to use a Force-Empowered
                    Self effect. Each effect uses a d4, which changes as you gain sentinel levels, as shown in the
                    Kinetic Combat column of the sentinel table. You have three such effects: Deflection, Double Strike,
                    and Slow Time. You can only use each effect once per turn, and you can only use one effect per hit.

                    DEFLECTION
                    You can roll a Kinetic Combat die and add it to your AC against one attack before the start of your
                    next turn.

                    DOUBLE STRIKE
                    You can roll a Kinetic Combat die and deal additional damage of the same type equal to the amount
                    rolled.

                    SLOW TIME
                    You can roll a Kinetic Combat die to increase your speed by 5 x the amount rolled until the end of
                    your turn.

                    more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

                    IDEAL OF THE AGILE
                    You gain a swimming speed and a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. When you make a long
                    jump, you can cover a number of feet up to twice your Wisdom or Charisma score (your choice). When
                    you make a high jump, you can leap a number of feet up into the air equal to 3 + twice your Wisdom
                    or Charisma modifier (your choice).

                    Additionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the
                    next minute, opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.

                    IDEAL OF THE ARTISAN
                    Choose one of your skill or tool proficiencies. When you make an ability check with the chosen skill
                    or tool, you can add half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) to any
                    check you make that doesn’t already include that modifier.

                    Additionally, as an action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the next 10
                    minutes, the bonus increases to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier, and you can choose a second skill
                    or tool to extend this feature to.

                    IDEAL OF THE CONTENDER
                    You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes,
                    and your unarmed strike damage increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8).

                    Additionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the
                    next minute, your unarmed strikes count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and
                    immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage, and you can use your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your
                    choice) instead of Strength for checks made to grapple a target or escape a grapple.

                    IDEAL OF THE FIGHTER
                    You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting style
                    options, detailed in Chapter 6.

                    Additionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the
                    next minute, you know the fighting mastery that corresponds with the fighting style you chose with
                    this feature. If you already know that fighting mastery, you instead learn another of your choice
                    for the duration.

                    IDEAL OF THE HUNTER
                    You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, this ideal increases
                    its range by 30 feet.

                    Additionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the
                    next minute, you can see normally in enhanced darkness, and you gain blindsight to 10 feet.

                    IDEAL OF THE STEADFAST
                    When you would make a melee weapon attack roll, you can instead force the target to make a Dexterity
                    saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon). If you would have advantage on your
                    attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have
                    disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw. On a
                    failed save, the target takes normal weapon damage and is subjected to any additional effects that
                    would occur on a hit.

                    Additionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the
                    next minute, when a creature succeeds on the saving throw, they take half the normal weapon damage,
                    and when a creature rolls a 1 on the saving throw, they treat the damage as if you had rolled the
                    maximum.

                    IDEAL OF THE TITAN
                    You gain proficiency in medium armor.

                    Additionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the
                    next minute, you have advantage on ability checks and attack rolls that would forcefully move
                    another creature, and the distance they would be moved increases by 5 feet.

                    IDEAL OF THE TRANQUIL
                    When you finish a short or long rest, you gain a number of temporary force points equal to half your
                    Wisdom or Charisma modifier (rounded up, your choice, minimum of one). When you would spend a force
                    point while you have temporary force points, the temporary force points are spent first. All
                    temporary force points are lost at the end of your next short or long rest.

                    Additionally, as an action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. You regain a
                    number of force points equal to half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (rounded up, your choice,
                    minimum of one).

                    IDEAL OF THE VIGOROUS
                    When you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, you may use your Wisdom or Charisma modifier in place
                    of your Constitution modifier when determining the number of hit points you regain.

                    Additionally, as an action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. You gain a
                    number of temporary hit points equal to half your sentinel level (rounded down) + your Wisdom or
                    Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one).

                <text>You attract the attention of the spirit of a Force ghost. Your spirit might be the ghost of a
                    benevolent Jedi, discovered in the ruins of a Jedi temple, or a powerful Sith spirit lingering in an
                    ancient artifact. It might be the spirit of a Nightsister sorceress, or a paragon of a
                    long-forgotten monastic order. Work with your GM to determine the nature of your spirit. Over the
                    course of one hour, you can attune to the spirit, forging a lasting connection. While attuned to a
                    spirit, you gain the following benefits:

                    Your spirit is always audible and visible to you. Your spirit can choose to make itself audible and
                    visible or inaudible and invisible to other creatures (no action required), but it is always visible
                    to beings with truesight.
                    Your spirit can not interact with the corporeal world, but it is also not impeded by unenhanced
                    walls or barriers.
                    Your spirit acts independently of you, and it only obeys your commands if it chooses to. In combat,
                    it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. Your spirit can’t attack, but it can take
                    other actions as normal.
                    While your spirit is within 100 feet of you, you can telepathically communicate with it.
                    Additionally, as an action, you can see through your spirit’s vision and hear what it hears until
                    the start of your next turn. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own
                    senses.
                    When you cast a force power with a range of touch, your spirit can deliver the power as if it had
                    cast it. Your spirit must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the
                    power when you cast it. If the power requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the
                    roll.

                    You can only attune to one spirit at a time. If you attempt to attune to another spirit, you
                    immediately break the bond with your current spirit.

                    Additionally, your spirit can briefly interact with the physical world. When you would make a melee
                    attack, your spirit can deliver the attack as if it had made it. Your spirit must be within 100 feet
                    of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the attack. It uses your modifiers for the attack
                    and damage rolls. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma
                    modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or

                    each of your turns, roll a d20. If you roll 11 or higher, you and everything your are wearing or
                    carrying are completely invisible to all beings, except for those with truesight. On a roll of 10 or
                    lower, you instead appear as an indistinguishably blurred form roughly your normal height and
                    weight, though a being with truesight sees you normally. Regardless of your appearance, for the
                    duration, your speed doubles, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you can move
                    through creatures and objects willingly though you can not affect them and they can not affect you.
                    You can end this feature early on your turn (no action required). When this effect ends, if you are
                    inside a solid object or creature, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that
                    you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.

                    This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you’ve used this feature, you must
                    complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

                    use your bonus action to teleport to within 5 feet of that creature and make a melee weapon attack
                    against that creature. This attack uses your Kinetic Combat die instead of your weapon’s damage die.
                    You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (a minimum of

                    You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a
                    minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

                    DISRUPTION PULSE
                    As an action, you can send out a 30 foot cone of electromagnetically-charged energy to overload
                    enemy weapons. Each creature within the cone that is wearing or carrying a weapon with electric
                    components must make an Intelligence saving throw. If the weapon is being worn, this save is made
                    with disadvantage. On a failed save, the first attack they attempt to make with that weapon has
                    disadvantage. A creature with multiple weapons must make a separate save for each weapon.

                    FORCED OVERRIDE
                    When you cast a tech power that requires a saving throw, you can impose disadvantage on the save (no
                    action required).

                    TECHCASTING INSIGHT
                    As an action, you can attempt to determine another creature’s experience with techcasting. When you
                    do so, you make an Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the target’s Intelligence
                    (Technology) check. If you succeed, you immediately learn the target’s techcasting Max Power Level,
                    as well as any tech powers currently affecting the target.

                    As an action, you can telekinetically control your forceblade and have it strike any number of
                    creatures within 10 feet of you, spending 1 force point per target. Each target must make a
                    Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to weapon attack rolls with that weapon). On a failed
                    save, it takes damage using your Kinetic Combat die + half your sentinel level (rounded down), is
                    pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone.

                <text>Your training has taught you advanced techniques while you maneuver in the shadows. While you are
                    hidden from your target, the first attack roll you make each round does not automatically reveal
                    your presence. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check against your target’s Wisdom (Perception) check. On
                    a success, you remain hidden. If you are also invisible, you remain invisible.

                    against the triggering damage, and if the source of the damage is within 5 feet of you, they take
                    half of the total damage dealt as ion.

                    this damage is not reduced to 0, the warded creature takes any remaining damage.

                    You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a
                    minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

                    You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.
                    You have resistance to energy, lightning, and necrotic damage.
                    Whenever a hostile creature enters this radius or starts its turn there, it takes 10 lightning
                    damage.

                    This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you’ve used this feature, you can’t use

            <text>The trials and triumphs of retired adventurers have left an impact, shaping their ideals, creating
                strong bonds, and often leaving them scarred and vulnerable to fear, shame, and hatred.
                Personality:
                1. I&#39;m always polite and respectful.
                2. I&#39;m haunted by memories of war. I can&#39;t get the images of violence out of my mind.
                3. I&#39;ve lost too many friends, and I&#39;m slow to make new ones.
                4. I&#39;m full of inspiring and cautionary tales from my adventuring experience relevant to almost
                every combat situation.
                5. I can stare down a rancor without flinching.
                6. I enjoy being strong and like breaking things.
                7. I have a crude sense of humor.
                8. I face problems head-on. A simple, direct solution is the best path to success.

                Ideals:
                1. Greater Good. Our lot is to lay down our lives in defense of others. (Light)
                2. Responsibility. I do what I must and obey just authority. (Lawful)
                3. Independence. When people follow orders blindly, they embrace a kind of tyranny. (Chaotic)
                4. Might. In life as in war, the stronger force wins. (Dark)
                5. Live and Let Live. Ideals aren&#39;t worth killing over or going to war for. (Neutral)
                6. Nation. My city, nation, or people are all that matter. (Any)

                Bond:
                1. I would still lay down my life for the people I adventured with.
                2. Someone saved my life when they could have left me. To this day, I will never leave a friend behind.
                3. My honor is my life.
                4. I&#39;ll never forget the crushing defeat my party suffered or the enemies who dealt it.
                5. Those who fight beside me are those worth dying for.
                6. I fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.

                Flaw:
                1. The monstrous enemy we faced in battle still leaves me quivering with fear.
                2. I have little respect for anyone who is not a proven adventurer.
                3. I made a terrible mistake in battle cost many livesï¿½ and I would do anything to keep that mistake
                secret.
                4. My hatred of my enemies is blind and unreasoning.
                5. I obey the law, even if the law causes misery.
                6. I&#39;d rather eat my armor than admit when I&#39;m wrong.

                1 I am guaranteed to fight someone if I&#39;m drunk/high enough.

                4 The only thing keeping me from burning down this village is the fact that you make some damn good

                7 I take pride in my addiction and am often snobbish when talking about it.

                1. I idolize a particular hero of my faction, and constantly refer to that person&#39;s deeds and
                example.
                2. I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working

                7. I&#39;ve enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my faction&#39;s elite. Rough living grates
                on me.
                8. I have little practical experience dealing with people in the world.

                1. Tradition. The ancient traditions of worship and sacrifice must be preserved and upheld. (Lawful)
                2. Charity. I always try to help those in need, no matter what the personal cost. (Light)
                3. Change. We must help bring about the changes the gods are constantly working in the world. (Chaotic)

                6. Aspiration. I seek to prove myself worthy of my leader&#39;s favor by matching my actions against his
                or her teachings. (Any)

                Bond:

                1. I always have a plan for what to do when things go wrong.

                things could be hidden.
                4. I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.

                4. I will become the greatest thief that ever lived.

                6. Someone I loved died because of a mistake I made. That will never happen again.

                Flaw:
                1. When I see something valuable, I can&#39;t think about anything but how to steal it.

                3. If there&#39;s a plan, I&#39;ll forget it. If I don&#39;t forget it, I&#39;ll ignore it.
                4. I have a ï¿½tellï¿½ that reveals when I&#39;m lying.
                5. I turn tail and run when things look bad.
                6. An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I&#39;m okay with that.

            <text>The noble court or bureaucratic organization where you got your start is directly or indirectly
                associated with your bond (which could pertain to certain individuals in the group, such as your sponsor
                or mentor). Your ideal might be concerned with the prevailing philosophy of your court or organization.
                Personality:
                1. I believe that anything worth doing is worth doing right. I can&#39;t help itï¿½ I&#39;m a
                perfectionist.
                2. I&#39;m a snob who looks down on those who can&#39;t appreciate fine art.

                7. I don&#39;t part with my money easily and will haggle tirelessly to get the best deal possible.
                8. I&#39;m well known for my work, so I&#39;m always taken aback when people haven&#39;t heard of me.

                Ideals:
                1. Community. It is the duty of all civilized people to strengthen the bonds of community and the
                security of civilization. (Lawful)
                2. Generosity. My talents were given to me so that I could use them to benefit the world. (Light)
                3. Freedom. Everyone should be free to pursue his or her own livelihood. (Chaotic)
                4. Greed. I&#39;m only in it for the money. (Dark)

                6. Aspiration. I work hard to be the best there is at my craft. (Any)

                Bond:
                1. The location where I learned my trade is the most important place in the world to me.
                2. I created a great work for someone unworthy to receive it. I&#39;m still looking for someone worthy.
                3. I owe someone a great debt for forging me into the person I am today.
                4. I pursue wealth to secure someone&#39;s love.
                5. One day I will return to my guild and prove that I am the greatest artisan of them all.
                6. I will get revenge on the Dark forces that destroyed my place of business and ruined my livelihood.

                Flaw:

                2. I&#39;m quick to assume that someone is trying to cheat me.
                3. No one must ever learn that I once stole money from guild coffers.

            <text>Crime lords might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But
                some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. Unlike common thieves, some
                crime lords even have some respect for law and authority, with whom they play a cat-and-mouse type game.
                Personality:
                1. I always have a plan for what to do when things go wrong.
                2. I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let me emotions control me.
                3. My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel like the most wonderful and important person in
                the world.
                4. I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.

                6. My favor, once lost, is lost forever.
                7. If you do me an injury, I will crush you, ruin your name, and salt your fields.
                8. I blow up at the slightest insult.

                Ideals:
                1. Honor. I don&#39;t steal from others in the trade. (Lawful)
                2. Freedom. Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them. (Chaotic)
                3. Charity. I steal from the wealthy so that I can help people in need. (Light)
                4. Greed. I will do whatever it takes to become wealthy. (Dark)
                5. People. I&#39;m loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the

                6. Redemption. There&#39;s a spark of good in everyone. (Light)

                2. My ill-gotten gains go to support my family.
                3. Something important was taken from me, and I aim to steal it back.
                4. The common folk must see me as a hero of the people.
                5. I&#39;m guilty of a terrible crime. I hope I can redeem myself for it.
                6. Someone I loved died because of a mistake I made. That will never happen again.

                Flaw:
                1. I secretly believe that everyone is beneath me.
                2. When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money.
                3. I too often hear veiled insults and threats in every word addressed to me, and I&#39;m quick to

            <text>Dathomir Witches are shaped by their training. They study their book of laws and use it to uphold
                order and prevent one&#39;s turn to the dark side. Their clan and the people around them affects their
                mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond
                taken to an extreme.
                Personality:
                1. I try and bring my culture to outsiders.
                2. I always put my clan first.
                3. I follow my clan&#39;s book of law to the letter.
                4. I once ran twenty-five miles without stopping to warn to my clan of an approaching rival clan. I&#39;d
                do it again if I had to.
                5. I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. Credits and manners won&#39;t save you from a
                hungry rancor.
                6. I have a lesson for every situation, drawn from observing nature.
                7. I feel far more comfortable around wildlife than I do society.
                8. I&#39;m always picking things up, absently fiddling with them, and sometimes accidentally breaking
                them.

                Ideals:
                1. Change. Life is like the seasons, in constant change, and we must change with it. (Chaotic)

                5. Nature. The natural world is more important than all the constructs of civilization. (Neutral)
                6. Glory. I must earn glory in battle, for myself and my clan. (Any)

                Bond:
                1. My family and clan is the most important thing in my life, even when they are far from me.
                2. An injury to the unspoiled wilderness of my home is an injury to me.
                3. I am the last of my clan, and it is up to me to keep the traditions of my ancestors alive.
                4. It is my duty to provide children to sustain my clan.
                5. I suffer awful visions of a coming disaster and will do anything to prevent it.
                6. I will bring terrible wrath down on those who disrespect my clan.

                Flaw:
                1. I stick to my traditions no matter what, even at the cost of others.
                2. There&#39;s no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest.
                3. I remember every insult I&#39;ve received and nurse a silent resentment toward anyone who&#39;s ever
                wronged me.
                4. I am slow to trust members of other species, clans, and societies.
                5. Violence is my answer to almost any challenge.
                6. Don&#39;t expect me to save those who can&#39;t save themselves. It is nature&#39;s way that the
                strong thrive and the weak perish.

            <text>Successful entertainers have to be able to capture and hold an audience&#39;s attention, so they tend
                to have flamboyant or forceful personalities. They&#39;re inclined toward the romantic and often cling
                to high-minded ideals about the practice of art and the appreciation of beauty.
                Personality:
                1. I know a story relevant to almost every situation.
                2. Whenever I come to a new place, I collect local rumors and spread gossip.
                3. I&#39;m a hopeless romantic, always searching for that ï¿½special someone.ï¿½
                4. Nobody stays angry at me or around me for long, since I can defuse any amount of tension.
                5. I love a good insult, even one directed at me.
                6. I get bitter if I&#39;m not the center of attention.
                7. I&#39;ll settle for nothing less than perfection.
                8. I change my mood or my mind as quickly as I change key in a song.

                Ideals:
                1. Beauty. When I perform, I make the world better than it was. (Light)
                2. Tradition. The stories, legends, and songs of the past must never be forgotten, for they teach us who
                we are. (Lawful)
                3. Creativity. The world is in need of new ideas and bold action. (Chaotic)
                4. Greed. I&#39;m only in it for the money and fame. (Dark)
                5. People. I like seeing the smiles on people&#39;s faces when I perform. That&#39;s all that matters.
                (Neutral)
                6. Honesty. Art should reflect the soul; it should come from within and reveal who we really are. (Any)

                Bond:
                1. My instrument is my most treasured possession, and it reminds me of someone I love.
                2. Someone stole my precious instrument, and someday I&#39;ll get it back.
                3. I want to be famous, whatever it takes.
                4. I idolize a hero of the old tales and measure my deeds against that person&#39;s.
                5. I will do anything to prove myself superior to my hated rival.
                6. I would do anything for the other members of my old troupe.

                Flaw:
                1. I&#39;ll do anything to win fame and renown.
                2. I&#39;m a sucker for a pretty face.
                3. A scandal prevents me from ever going home again. That kind of trouble seems to follow me around.
                4. I once satirized a noble who still wants my head. It was a mistake that I will likely repeat.
                5. I have trouble keeping my true feelings hidden. My sharp tongue lands me in trouble.
                6. Despite my best efforts, I am unreliable to my friends.

            <text>Faction merchants are among the most ordinary people in the world, until they abscond to take up an
                adventuring career. They understand the value of hard work and the importance of community, but they&#39;re
                vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness.

                d8 Personality Trait
                1 I believe that anything worth doing is worth doing right. I can&#39;t help it; I&#39;m a
                perfectionist.
                2 I&#39;m a snob who looks down on those who can&#39;t appreciate fine art.
                3 I always want to know how things work and what makes people tick.
                4 I&#39;m full of witty aphorisms and have a proverb for every occasion.
                5 I&#39;m rude to people who lack my commitment to hard work and fair play.
                6 I like to talk at length about my profession.
                7 I don&#39;t part with my money easily and will haggle tirelessly to get the best deal possible.
                8 I believe I&#39;m well known for my work, and I&#39;m always taken aback when people haven&#39;t heard
                of me.

                d6 Ideal
                1 Community. It is the duty of all civilized people to strengthen the bonds of community and the
                security of civilization. (Lawful)
                2 Generosity. My talents were given to me so that I could use them to benefit the world. (Light)
                3 Freedom. Everyone should be free to pursue his or her own livelihood. (Chaotic)
                4 Greed. I&#39;m only in it for the money. (Dark)
                5 People. I&#39;m committed to the people I care about, not to ideals. (Neutral)
                6 Aspiration. I work hard to be the best there is at my craft. (Any)

                d6 Bond
                1 The workshop where I learned my trade is the most important place in the world to me.
                2 I commissioned a great work for someone unworthy of it; I now search for someone worthy.
                3 I owe my faction a great debt for forging me into the person I am today.
                4 I pursue wealth to secure someone&#39;s love.
                5 One day I will return to my faction and prove that I am the greatest artisan of them all.
                6 I will get revenge on the Dark forces that destroyed my place of business and ruined my livelihood.

                d6 Flaw
                1 I&#39;ll do anything to get my hands on something rare or priceless.
                2 I&#39;m quick to assume that someone is trying to cheat me.
                3 No one must ever learn that I once stole money from faction coffers.
                4 I&#39;m never satisfied with what I have. I always want more.
                5 I would kill to acquire a noble title.
                6 I&#39;m horribly jealous of anyone who can outshine my handiwork. Everywhere I go, I&#39;m surrounded
                by rivals.

                space in innocence, or reacting to invasion of my own.

            <text>A farmer is one of the common people and unusually tied to their home and the land. Most farmers look

            <text>Gambling is your passion, for better or for worse. Most gamblers see their vices as virtues, and
                overlook things in their pursuit of the rush.
                Personality:
                1. I like to impress everyone I meet with a simple trick or a quick joke.
                2. I constantly make side bets on everything that happens around me.
                3. No matter how high the stakes, I always appear calm.
                4. I try to be unpredictable, so no one will know when I&#39;m bluffing.
                5. I never back down from a challenge.
                6. I can&#39;t get satisfaction out of something if the stakes are too low.
                7. I tend to make friends out of enemies, and enemies out of friends.
                8. I prefer one game above all others.

                Ideals:
                1. Risk. Nothing worth doing is ever a sure thing. (Chaotic)
                2. Victory. Never make a bet unless you&#39;re sure you can win. (Lawful)
                3. Gred. Anything that isn&#39;t mine soon will be. (Dark)
                4. Charity. I share my winnings with the less fortunate. (Light)
                5. Surprise. Life is a game worth playing, because you never know how the dice will land. (Any)
                6. Laziness. Working is for chumps. (Any)

                Bond:
                1. I owe a lot of money to the wrong kind of people.
                2. I still keep the first coin I ever won. It&#39;s my good luck charm.
                3. Most of my winnings go to my home.
                4. Someday I will own my own casino.
                5. I lost a large sum of money to a con artist; I seek to get it back.
                6. I hide my gambling behind a normal life. My friends have no idea who I really am.

                Flaw:
                1. I can&#39;t step away from the table when I&#39;m losing.
                2. I spend money faster than I can make it.
                3. Everyone has a price. Mine happens to be pretty low.
                4. I assume everyone is hiding something from me.
                5. I tend to value money more than people.
                6. I like to think I could drink anyone under the table, but I&#39;m really a lightweight.

                Personality:
                1. I know a story relevant to almost every situation.
                2. Whenever I come to a new place, I collect local rumors and spread gossip.
                3. I&#39;m a hopeless romantic, always searching for that ï¿½special someone.ï¿½
                4. Nobody stays angry at me or around me for long, since I can defuse any amount of tension.
                5. I love a good insult, even one directed at me.
                6. I get bitter if I&#39;m not the center of attention.
                7. I&#39;ll settle for nothing less than perfection.
                8. I change my mood or my mind as quickly as I change key in a song.

                Ideals:
                1. Beauty. When I perform, I make the world better than it was. (Light)
                2. Tradition. The stories, legends, and songs of the past must never be forgotten, for they teach us who
                we are. (Lawful)
                3. Creativity. The world is in need of new ideas and bold action. (Chaotic)
                4. Greed. I&#39;m only in it for the money and fame. (Dark)
                5. People. I like seeing the smiles on people&#39;s faces when I perform. That&#39;s all that matters.
                (Neutral)
                6. Honesty. Art should reflect the soul; it should come from within and reveal who we really are. (Any)

                Bond:
                1. My instrument is my most treasured possession, and it reminds me of someone I love.
                2. Someone stole my precious trophy, and someday I&#39;ll get it back.
                3. I want to be famous, whatever it takes.
                4. I idolize a hero of the old tales and measure my deeds against that person&#39;s.
                5. I will do anything to prove myself superior to my hated rival.
                6. I would do anything for the other members of my old troupe.

                Flaw:
                1. I&#39;ll do anything to win fame and renown.
                2. I&#39;m a sucker for a pretty face.
                3. A scandal prevents me from ever going home again. That kind of trouble seems to follow me around.
                4. I once satirized a noble who still wants my head. It was a mistake that I will likely repeat.
                5. I have trouble keeping my true feelings hidden. My sharp tongue lands me in trouble.
                6. Despite my best efforts, I am unreliable to my friends.

                1. I&#39;ve been isolated for so long that I rarely speak, preferring gestures and the occasional grunt.

                them.
                3. I&#39;m still seeking the enlightenment I pursued in my seclusion, and it still eludes me.

                1 I tend to think any broadcaster is a fraud immediately unless they prove otherwise.
                2 I tend to repeat the same mistake unless it is pointed out to me.
                3 I will ramble endlessly about a random holonet broadcast that I saw which I think was the best ever.
                4 I think everyone who works a normal job is a drone without the ability to think freely.
                5 I describe everything using references to obscure holonet recordings.
                6 I&#39;ve become completely desensitized to violence and graphic imagery, to the point where I laugh in
                an off putting way whenever I see it.

            <text>Jedi are shaped by their experience in their temple. Their study of the history and tenets of the Jedi
                Order and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals.
                Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.
                Personality:
                1. I idolize a particular Jedi, and constantly refer to that person&#39;s deeds and example.
                2. I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working
                towards peace.
                3. I see omens in every event and action. The Force tries to speak to us, we just need to listen
                4. Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude.
                5. I quote (or misquote) sacred Jedi texts and proverbs in almost every situation.
                6. I am tolerant (or intolerant) of those who don&#39;t support the Jedi.
                7. I&#39;ve enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society. Rough living grates on me.
                8. I&#39;ve spent so long in the Jedi temple that I have little practical experience dealing with people
                in the world.

                Ideals:
                1. Tradition. The ancient traditions of worship and sacrifice must be preserved and upheld. (Lawful)
                2. Charity. I always try to help those in need, no matter what the personal cost. (Light)
                3. Change. We must help bring about the changes the Force is constantly working in the world. (Chaotic)
                4. Power. I hope to one day rise to the rank of Jedi Master. (Lawful)
                5. Faith. I trust that the Force will guide my actions; I have faith that if I work hard, things will go
                well. (Lawful)
                6. Aspiration. I seek to prove myself worthy of the Force by matching my actions against the Jedi
                teachings. (Any)

                Bond:
                1. I would die to recover an ancient Jedi relic that was lost long ago.
                2. I will someday get revenge on those who razed my temple.
                3. I owe my life to the Jedi who took me in when my parents died.
                4. Everything I do is for the common people.
                5. I will do anything to protect the temple where I served.
                6. I seek to preserve a sacred text that my enemies seek to destroy.

                Flaw:
                1. I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely.
                2. I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple&#39;s hierarchy.
                3. My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in the Force.
                4. I am inflexible in my thinking.
                5. I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them.
                6. Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment of everything else in my life.

                6. Defiant to the last isn&#39;t good enough. Upon death I will become a force spirit and continue to
                defy my killer.
                7. Well-behaved people rarely make history.
                8. What gave you the idea that I was going to give you a fair fight?

                6. Redemption. There&#39;s a spark of good in everyone. (Light)

                Bond:
                1. The Jensaarai took me in when nobody else would. I back the order 100%.
                2. I was once a Jedi, but grew disillusioned by their inactivity.
                3. I fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.
                4. I lost my mentor in battle. I will honor their sacrifice by destroying their killer.
                5. I was able to slough off Dark Side corruption, but I couldn&#39;t avoid making amends.
                6. The powerful use their strength to raise people up, not keep them down.

                Flaw:
                1. I might be a little too enamored with force choking my enemies.
                2. I am my own worst critic, in everything I do.
                3. My armor is precision crafted and has served me faithfully. I never give up a chance to prove how
                well.
                4. I have a collection of lightsabers from fallen foes, and I love adding to it.
                5. The Jedi and Sith worship the Force as a religion. I do everything I can to remind them they&#39;re
                just worshipping a hammer.
                6. The minute you tell me that someone should not be crossed, I&#39;m already crossing them.

            <text>You are familiar with the letter of the law and workings of courts, at least on the planet that you
                were a judge in. If you are in a foreign place where you are not familiar with their exact laws, you
                often will be able to track down the resources you need to learn them.

                If you or your party gets into legal trouble, your experience may help you get out of it. If you can
                prove your credentials, you might be able to represent your party in a court of law without
                admonishment. You may know of legal loopholes that will help your case. If you are in the region where
                you originally worked, you might have past connections with many legal professionals there.

            <text>A lawyer&#39;s career is centered on issues of right, wrong, and punishment, so they will approach
                adventuring through a similar lens. They are used to being respected and in control, leading many of
                them to struggle with wild, Any situations.
                Personality:

                5. Control. I enforce the law only where it benefits myself. (Dark)
                6. Stability. The purpose of the law is to keep civilization from collapsing. That spirit of that goal
                is more important than the letter of the law. (Neutral)

                Bond:

                strive to live by this code as much as possible by remaining honorable. Your flaw(s) might consist of

            <text>Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their
                personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bondsï¿½responsibilities

                Ideals:

            <text>Often considered rude and uncouth among civilized folk, nomads have little respect for the niceties of
                life in the cities. The ties of tribe, clan, family, and the natural world are the most important bonds
                to nomads.
                Personality:
                1. I&#39;m driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home.
                2. I watch over my friends as if they were a litter of newborn pups.
                3. I once ran twenty-five miles without stopping to warn to my clan of an approaching orc horde. I&#39;d
                do it again if I had to.
                4. I have a lesson for every situation, drawn from observing nature.
                5. I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. Money and manners won&#39;t save you from a hungry
                owlbear.
                6. I&#39;m always picking things up, absently fiddling with them, and sometimes accidentally breaking
                them.
                7. I feel far more comfortable around animals than people.
                8. I was, in fact, raised by wolves.

                Ideals:
                1. Change. Life is like the seasons, in constant change, and we must change with it. (Chaotic)
                2. Greater Good. It is each person&#39;s responsibility to make the most happiness for the whole tribe.
                (Light)
                3. Honor. If I dishonor myself, I dishonor my whole clan. (Lawful)
                4. Might. The strongest are meant to rule. (Dark)
                5. Nature. The natural world is more important than all the constructs of civilization. (Neutral)
                6. Glory. I must earn glory in battle, for myself and my clan. (Any)

                Bond:
                1. My family, clan, or tribe is the most important thing in my life, even when they are far from me.
                2. An injury to the unspoiled wilderness of my home is an injury to me.
                3. I will bring terrible wrath down on the Darkdoers who destroyed my homeland.
                4. I am the last of my tribe, and it is up to me to ensure their names enter legend.
                5. I suffer awful visions of a coming disaster and will do anything to prevent it.
                6. It is my duty to provide children to sustain my tribe.

                Flaw:
                1. I am too enamored of ale, wine, and other intoxicants.
                2. There&#39;s no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest.
                3. I remember every insult I&#39;ve received and nurse a silent resentment toward anyone who&#39;s ever
                wronged me.
                4. I am slow to trust members of other species, tribes, and societies.
                5. Violence is my answer to almost any challenge.
                6. Don&#39;t expect me to save those who can&#39;t save themselves. It is nature&#39;s way that the
                strong thrive and the weak perish.

                towards peace.
                2. I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let me emotions control me.
                3. I have little practical experience dealing with people in the world and prefer to work alone.
                4. I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.
                5. I am always figuring out how to implement better procedures to prevent mistakes.

                me. (Lawful)

                4. Greed. I will do whatever it takes to climb to the top. (Dark)
                5. People. I&#39;m loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the
                Styx for all I care. (Neutral)
                6. Faith. I trust that my leader will guide my actions, I have faith that if I work hard, things will go
                well. (Any)

                Bond:

            <text>Despite the cutthroat nature of the business, pirates come in all shapes and personalities. Some are
                bloodthirsty brigands who leave no survivors, others are free spirits who believe in strength over
                weakness. The hardened warriors of deep space can be implacable foes who often form unshakable bonds

                them vulnerable to greed, shame, and the scars of fear and horror left by battle.
                Personality:
                1. I respect my captain and trust my crew. It may be all that saves my life one day.
                2. Whether the credits comes from the split of the spoils or from a side wager, I&#39;ll get my hands on
                it.
                3. When my blood gets up, my swearing could boil the icy tundra of Hoth.

                5. I never let witnesses escape from a raid.

                1. Equal Shares. All hands who spend sweat and blood earn their share of the credits. (Lawful)

                4. Strength. The weak exist to feed the strong, and I am strong. (Dark)
                5. Crew. A ship is nothing without her crew. Protect your mates. (Neutral)
                6. Ambition. One day I will be so much more than a captain. (Any)

                Bond:
                1. My band and I will be known across the world, and we&#39;ll never be forgotten.
                2. My ill-gotten gains go to support my family.
                3. Everything I do is for the good of my people.
                4. My ship and many of her crew were lost to treachery, and I won&#39;t rest until I discover who was
                behind it.
                5. My ship comes first, and all other loyalties simply pale in comparison.
                6. A crew member of a ship we raided saved my life, and I don&#39;t know how to resolve that debt.

                Flaw:
                1. I never back down from a fight.
                2. When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money.
                3. I was drunk on watch when my ship was lost to an ambush. I can&#39;t set the shame aside.
                4. I feel I&#39;m entitled to a greater share of the spoils, no matter the circumstances.
                5. I won&#39;t let myself be captured. If a raid goes sour, I&#39;m the first to run for cover.
                6. I get lost in the thrill of the raid and can&#39;t focus on the details of a plan.

            <text>You have a preternatural instinct for understanding the terrain, interpreting maps, and planning

                significant danger or may be temporarily impassable.

            <text>Racers are usually competitive and often fearless. They can lead a whirlwind of a life, and sometimes
                the adrenaline of the race is no longer enough for them.
                Personality:
                1. Win or lose. There is no try.
                2. Giving up is never an option for me.
                3. I spit and laugh in the face of danger.
                4. Why do something if there is not the possibility of death?
                5. I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me.
                6. I don&#39;t pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds.
                7. The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can&#39;t do it.
                8. I blow up at the slightest insult.

                Ideals:
                1. Victory. It&#39;s not a victory if you don&#39;t follow the rules. (Lawful)
                2. Win. A win is a win, no matter how it&#39;s done. (Chaotic)
                3. Charity. I share my winnings with the less fortunate. (Light)
                4. Pride. I will do whatever it takes to be recognized as the best. (Dark)
                5. Excitement. Life is a race worth entering, because you never know how the ships will fly. (Neutral)
                6. Victory. Nothing worth doing is ever a sure thing. (Any)

                Bond:
                1. There is nothing more important to me than my vehicle.
                2. I will win the Coruscant Invitational one day.
                3. I&#39;m trying to pay off the debt on my vehicle.
                4. I owe a lot of money to the wrong kind of people.
                5. I do what feels good. Let&#39;s see the authorities catch me.
                6. Someone I loved died because they were too slow. That will never happen to me.

                Flaw:
                1. I think most people in life are content with a participation trophy. They disgust me.
                2. I classify everyone I meet as a winner or a loser. There&#39;s only ever one winner.
                3. There is not a drug I won&#39;t try.
                4. Once I start drinking, it&#39;s hard for me to stop.
                5. Once someone questions my courage, I never back down no matter how dangerous the situation.
                6. Waiting around makes me antsy. I&#39;d rather do something stupid than do nothing at all.

            <text>Scientist are interested in things most don&#39;t care about. Their research is their life, and drives
                their personality traits. Their flaws, ideals, and bond are a result of their hours spent researching.
                Personality:
                1. I look up to a renowned scientist in my field, and often talk about their work.
                2. I constantly compare my current situation to my past experiments, many of which went terrifyingly
                wrong.
                3. I believe scientific results always comes first.
                4. I only speak in short incomplete and concise sentences, as they are optimized for efficient
                communication.
                5. I often get lost in my own thoughts and contemplation, becoming oblivious to my surroundings.
                6. I am unable to think logically under great stress, and begin to shout random scientific words.
                7. I do not believe in etiquette and disregard social expectations.
                8. I was, in fact, grown and raised in a laboratory.

                Ideals:
                1. Transparency. All discoveries should be open to everyone. (Light)
                2. Logic. Emotions must not cloud our sense of what is right and true, or our logical thinking. (Lawful)
                3. Greed. I&#39;m only in it for the money and fame. (Dark)
                4. Free Thinking. Inquiry and curiosity are the pillars of progress. (Chaotic)
                5. Live and Let Live. Meddling in the affairs of others only causes trouble. (Balanced)
                6. Aspiration. I work hard to be the best there is at my craft. (Any)

                Bond:
                1. My research is also my best companion.
                2. I will get revenge on the criminals that stole my research.
                3. The school I studied at is the most important place in the world to me.
                4. One day I will return to my home planet and prove that I am the greatest scientist of them all.
                5. I believe my research will be the key to saving the life of a loved one.
                6. I owe my instructor a great debt for forging me into the person I am today.

                Flaw:
                1. I believe only other scientists deserve my respect.
                2. I fail to understand why people don&#39;t understand my technical jargon.
                3. I experiment on myself without thinking about the long term consequences.
                4. I am paranoid that people are out to steal my research.
                5. I believe I work better when under the influence of intoxicants.
                6. I work on my research to the point where I ignore my own bodily needs.

                reflect what people want to see, what they want to believe, and how they see the world. But their true
                selves are sometimes plagued by an uneasy conscience, an old enemy, or deep-seated trust issues.
                Personality:
                1. I fall in and out of love easily, and am always pursuing someone.
                2. I have a joke for every occasion, especially occasions where humor is inappropriate.
                3. Flattery is my preferred trick for getting what I want.
                4. I&#39;m a born gambler who can&#39;t resist taking a risk for a potential payoff.
                5. I lie about almost everything, even when there&#39;s no good reason to.
                6. Sarcasm and insults are my weapons of choice.
                7. I keep multiple symbols on me and invoke whatever power might come in useful at any given moment.

                Bond:
                1. I fleeced the wrong person and must work to ensure that this individual never crosses paths with me
                or those I care about.
                2. I owe everything to my mentorï¿½a horrible person who&#39;s probably rotting in jail somewhere.
                3. Somewhere out there, I have a child who doesn&#39;t know me. I&#39;m making the world better for him
                or her.
                4. I come from a noble family, and one day I&#39;ll reclaim my lands and title from those who stole them
                from me.
                5. A powerful person killed someone I love. Some day soon, I&#39;ll have my revenge.
                6. I swindled and ruined a person who didn&#39;t deserve it, and I seek to atone for my misdeeds.

                Flaw:
                1. I can&#39;t resist a pretty face.
                2. I&#39;m always in debt. I spend my ill-gotten gains on decadent luxuries faster than I bring them in.
                3. I&#39;m convinced that no one could ever fool me the way I fool others.
                4. I&#39;m too greedy for my own good. I can&#39;t resist taking a risk if there&#39;s money involved.
                5. I can&#39;t resist swindling people who are more powerful than me.
                6. I hate to admit it and will hate myself for it, but I&#39;ll run and preserve my own hide if the

                5. I dote over my companions like a concerned mother bird, fixing their clothing and making sure they
                look nice.
                6. I hated my time as a servant, and go out of my way to enjoy myself and let loose, rarely holding my

                7. I rarely show any emotions, remaining calm and stoic even in the worst of situations.
                8. I can-or think I can-diffuse the most tense and stressful of situations with the right word or
                phrase.

                3. Free. Noone should be bound in servitude. (Chaotic)
                4. Infiltrate. From the position of a servant, I can worm my way into places of power! (Dark)
                5. Payment. I don&#39;t care what my masters do; as long as I get paid. (Neutral)
                6. Live. I only wish to serve in peace. (Any)

                Bond:
                1. I am still loyal to my old master.
                2. The Lord I worked for is after my head, and will do anything to capture me.
                3. My family still live as servants; I hope to earn a better life for them.
                4. An older servant taught me the ropes and looked out for me; and I owe them a great debt.
                5. I will exact revenge on the bastards who ruined (or ended) my Master&#39;s life.
                6. I have plenty of friends in high places; and they&#39;ve come in useful from time to time.

                Flaw:
                1. I become incredibly nervous around people of power and importance.
                2. Saying that I&#39;m a little bossy is a bit of an understatement.
                3. I can be a sycophant, constantly fawning and flattering others; which can come off as shallow.
                4. I&#39;ve lived a relatively pampered life; the world of commoners is dull and painful to me.
                5. I never speak for myself, letting others walk all over me.
                6. I often can seem stiff, old fashioned and generally a stick in the mud.

            <text>Sith are shaped by their training. They study the Sith code and use it to oppress the weak and quell
                resistance. Their study of the Sith code affects their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some
                hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.
                Personality:
                1. I idolize a particular Sith, and constantly refer to that person&#39;s deeds and example.
                2. I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working
                towards peace.
                3. I see omens in every event and action. The Force tries to speak to us, we just need to listen
                4. Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude.
                5. I quote (or misquote) sacred Sith texts and proverbs in almost every situation.
                6. I am tolerant (or intolerant) of those who don&#39;t support the Sith.
                7. I&#39;ve enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society. Rough living grates on me.
                8. I&#39;ve spent so long in the Sith temple that I have little practical experience dealing with people
                in the world.

                Ideals:
                1. Tradition. The ancient traditions of worship and sacrifice must be preserved and upheld. (Any)
                2. Disdain. I never try to help those in need, regardless of how simple it would be. (Dark)
                3. Change. We must help bring about the changes the Force is constantly working in the world. (Any)
                4. Power. I hope to one day rise to the rank of Dark Lord of the Sith. (Any)
                5. Faith. I trust that the Force will guide my actions; I have faith that if I work hard, things will go
                well. (Any)
                6. Aspiration. I seek to prove myself worthy of the Force by matching my actions against the Sith
                teachings. (Any)

                Bond:
                1. I would die to recover an ancient Sith relic that was lost long ago.
                2. I will someday get revenge on those who razed my temple.
                3. I owe my life to the Sith who took me in when my parents died.
                4. Everything I do is for the common people.
                5. I will do anything to protect the temple where I served.
                6. I seek to preserve a sacred text that my enemies seek to destroy.

                Flaw:
                1. I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely.
                2. I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple&#39;s hierarchy.
                3. My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in the Force.
                4. I am inflexible in my thinking.
                5. I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them.
                6. Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment of everything else in my life.

            <text>Smugglers might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are nefarious to the core. But
                some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among
                thieves, but spies rarely show any respect for law or authority.
                Personality:
                1. I am extremely sociable, especially over a mug of ale.
                2. I always keep my wares close to me, you never know who might stumble across them otherwise.
                3. The best way to hide is out in the open.
                4. I&#39;m a terrible gossip.
                5. Being seen with any unsavory figures is a sure way to undermine my work, which is why I work out of
                sight.
                6. Deflecting questions has become second nature to me, so I rarely answer straight.
                7. I have dozens of identities and live in constant fear of answering to the wrong name.
                8. I act irrationally confident in the face of danger, nobody suspects anything when you seem like you&#39;re
                in charge.

                Ideals:
                1. Morals. I only smuggle things to improve the lives of the common folk. (Light)
                2. Ruthless. I will rise to the top of the heap by any means necessary. (Dark)
                3. Friendship. My associates are dear to me, and I want them to rise with me when I hit it big. (Lawful)
                4. Dauntless. No border crossing or bribe is too difficult- that&#39;s just the coward&#39;s way of
                saying exciting! (Chaotic)
                5. Greater. Good I work for a greater cause, and ply my trade only in service to it. (Any)
                6. Unperturbed. I only want to make a living for myself, and smuggling is just an edge I can use to do
                so. (Neutral)

                Bond:
                1. A corrupt official shut me down back in my honest days. I aim to show him a thing or two about
                recovery.
                2. I never wanted to be a criminal, but it pays the bills.
                3. A bloodthirsty pirate stole a shipment from me and killed a dear friend of mine. I will have my
                vengeance.
                4. Someone I cared about discovered my profession and has publicly denounced me, and I am caught between
                protecting my reputation and restoring our relationship.
                5. My love interest is someone who once stole from right under my nose- but they have no idea who I am
                or how much I admire them for their accomplishment.
                6. My business partners are closer to me than my family.

                Flaw:
                1. "Trust nobody, not even yourself." I am plagued by paranoia.
                2. I&#39;m so charismatic that sometimes I woo myself. Who am I, Narcissus?
                3. Money is my greatest motivator. I&#39;ll do almost anything given enough of it, even if I&#39;ll
                regret it later.
                4. I would betray anyone to save my own skin.
                5. I detach myself from the results of my actions in order to sleep better at night.
                6. Someone who knows me well might call me wo-faced" but those who don&#39;t have no idea what hit &#39;em.

                1. I&#39;m always polite and respectful.

                Personality:
                1. My crewmates know they can rely on me, no matter what.
                2. I work hard so that I can play hard when the work is done.
                3. I enjoy traveling into new systems and making new friends over a drink.
                4. I stretch the truth for the sake of a good story.
                5. To me, a bar brawl is a nice way to get to know a new city.
                6. I never pass up a friendly wager.
                7. The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can&#39;t do it.
                8. I like a job well done, especially if I can convince someone else to do it.

                Ideals:
                1. Respect. The thing that keeps a ship together is mutual respect between captain and crew. (Light)
                2. Fairness. We all do the work, so we all share in the rewards. (Lawful)
                3. Freedom. Space is freedom, the freedom to go anywhere and do anything. (Chaotic)
                4. Mastery. I&#39;m a predator, and the other ships we come across are my prey. (Dark)
                5. People. I&#39;m committed to my crewmates, not to ideals. (Neutral)
                6. Aspiration. Someday, I&#39;ll own my own ship and chart my own destiny. (Any)

                Bond:
                1. I&#39;m loyal to my captain first, everything else second.
                2. The ship is most importantï¿½crewmates and captains come and go.
                3. I&#39;ll always remember my first ship.
                4. I will become the greatest captain that ever lived.
                5. I was cheated out of my fair share of the profits, and I want to get my due.
                6. Ruthless space pirates murdered my captain and crewmates, stole all we owned, and left me lo die.
                Vengeance will be mine.

                Flaw:
                1. I follow orders, even if I think they&#39;re wrong.
                2. I&#39;ll say anything to avoid having to do extra work.
                3. Once someone questions my courage, I never back down no matter how dangerous the situation.
                4. Once I start drinking, it&#39;s hard for me to stop.
                5. I can&#39;t help but pocket loose coins and other trinkets I come across.
                6. My pride will probably lead to my destruction.

                Personality:

                3. I work to preserve a library, university, scriptorium, or monastery.
                4. My life&#39;s work is a series of tomes related to a specific field of lore.

                2. Most people scream and run when they see a monster. I stop and take notes on its anatomy.
                3. Unlocking an ancient mystery is worth the price of a civilization.
                4. I overlook obvious solutions in favor of complicated ones.

        <text>A device used to blow holes in larger constructs, a breaching charge creates a devastating explosion.
            Installing a breaching charge takes 1 minute. The charge can be set with a 6-second timer, or detonated
            remotely using a remote detonator.

            Once detonated, the breaching charge destroys an unenhanced section of wall up to 10 feet wide, 10 feet
            tall, and 5 feet deep. Additionally, each creature within 20 feet of the charge must make a DC 15 Dexterity
            saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage and 3d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a
            successful one. A construct makes this save with disadvantage. If the breaching charge is installed on the
            construct, it automatically fails the saving throw.

            have its speed halved until the end of your next turn. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points,
            that creature is frozen in carbonite for 1 hour.

            military, as well as by mercenaries, criminals, bounty hunters and even some Jedi.

            The suit itself offers decent protection from most types of attacks while maintaining maximum flexibility
            and minimum weight. However this armor is only recommended for light skirmishes.

            Disintegrate:
            When a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by a weapon with the disintegrate property, it must make a DC 12
            Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A
            disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A
            creature destroyed in this way can not be revitalized.

        <text>Gas grenades are primarily used to flush enemies out of cover and other protected areas, though there are

            can throw a grenade at a point you can see within range. The grenade explodes in a 15ft radius sphere of
            yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its
            area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses it.

            When a creature enters the fog’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature
            must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 1d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half
            as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature is poisoned while it is in
            the cloud. Droids, constructs and humanoids wearing appropriate protective equipment are uneffected.

        <text>Rather than an energy shield, heavy shields are physical composites of metal or plastic. They are much
            larger and more cumbersome, but they offer more protection than their smaller counterparts. Its cumbersome
            size, however, makes it unwieldy, and requires the use of a one-handed weapon with the light property in the
            other hand.

            Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls while wielding a heavy shield. A heavy shield’s size and
            bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

            Disintegrate:
            When a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by a weapon with the disintegrate property, it must make a DC 12
            Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A
            disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A
            creature destroyed in this way can not be revitalized.

            The IWS is a heavy weapon that can fire in three different modes. As a bonus action, you can switch between
            each mode, detailed below. Each mode contains and uses its own power source.

            Antiarmor: While in this mode, rather than traditional power cells, the IWS fires grenades. When firing a
            grenade at long range, creatures within the radius of the grenade’s explosion have advantage on the saving
            throw.

            Blaster: While in this mode, the weapon uses traditional power cells.

            Sniper: While in this mode, the weapon uses traditional power cells.

            A Large or smaller creature hit by an net is restrained until it is freed. An net has no effect on creatures
            that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10
            Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 kinetic or
            energy damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and
            destroying the net.

            When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack
            regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

            damage instead of energy, and when you hit with a shot it sets the ground beneath it in a 5-foot square
            ablaze. When a creature enters the fire or starts its turn there it must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving
            throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 fire damage.

        <text>Thermal detonators are palm-sized, spherical, and extremely deadly explosive weapons. In addition to being
            surprisingly powerful for their size, they can only be turned off by whoever turned them on. Thermal
            detonators have a range equal to 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. As an action, you can throw a grenade
            at a point you can see within range. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw.
            A creature takes 2d6 fire and 2d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one.
            Additionally, on a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

            The vapor projector does not make attack rolls. Rather than traditional power cells, the vapor projector
            uses specialized projector tanks, which, when fired, spray an area with the contents of the tank. Projector
            tanks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the tank’s effects. The DC for this saving throw
            is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).

        <text>BLINDED
            A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
            Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.


            CHARMED
            A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or enhanced
            effects.
            The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.


            DEAFENED
            A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.


            DISEASED
            A diseased creature suffers effects that vary based on the disease.


            EXHAUSTION
            Some special abilities and environmental hazards, and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching
            temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An
            effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.

            Exhaustion Level
            Level Effect
            1 Disadvantage on ability checks
            2 1 slowed level
            3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
            4 Hit point maximum halved
            5 4 slowed levels
            6 Death
            If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current exhaustion level
            increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.

            A creature suffers the effect of its current exhaustion level as well as all lower levels. For example, a
            creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has 1 slowed level and has disadvantage on ability checks.

            An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all
            exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.

            Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also
            ingested some food and drink.


            FRIGHTENED
            A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is
            within line of sight.
            The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.


            GRAPPLED
            A grappled creature has 4 slowed levels.
            The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).
            The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or
            grappling effect.


            INCAPACITATED
            An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.


            INVISIBLE
            An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of powers or a special sense. For the purpose of
            hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or
            any tracks it leaves.
            Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage.


            PARALYZED
            A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can’t move or speak.
            The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature
            have advantage.
            Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.


            PETRIFIED
            A petrified creature is transformed, along with any object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate
            substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.
            The creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
            Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
            The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
            The creature has resistance to all damage.
            The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is
            suspended, not neutralized.


            POISONED
            A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.


            PRONE
            A prone creature’s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
            The creature has disadvantage on melee attack rolls.
            The creature has disadvantage on ranged attack rolls against targets within 30 feet.
            An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.
            Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.


            RESTRAINED
            A restrained creature has 4 slowed levels.
            Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.
            The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.


            SHOCKED
            A shocked creature can’t take reactions
            On its turn, a shocked creature can take either an action or a bonus action, but not both.


            SLOWED
            Some abilities, effects, and hazards can lead to a special condition called slowed. Slowed is measured in
            four levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of slowed, as specified in the effect’s
            description.

            Slowed Level
            Level Effect
            1 Speed reduced by 15 feet
            2 Speed reduced by 25 feet
            3 Speed reduced by 30 feet
            4 Speed reduced to 0, and can’t benefit from any bonus to speed
            If an already slowed creature suffers another effect that causes it to be slowed, its current slowed level
            increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.

            An effect that removes slowed reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all slowed
            effects ending if a creature’s slowed level is reduced below 1.


            STUNNED
            A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move, and can speak only falteringly.
            The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
            Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.


            UNCONSCIOUS
            An unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its
            surroundings
            The creature drops whatever it’s holding and falls prone.
            The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
            Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
            Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

        <text>Akimbo Mastery PHB
            You’ve mastered fighting with two blasters, unleashing a volley of shots. While you are wielding separate
            weapons in each hand with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:

            When you roll the maximum on a weapon damage die against a creature, that creature suffers a -1 penalty on
            the first attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn.
            You can engage in Two-Weapon Fighting even when the weapons you are wielding lack the light property.
            You can reload two weapons when you would normally only be able to reload only one.
            When you take the Attack action, you can choose to attack swiftly at the expense of accuracy. Your weapon
            attack is made without the aid of your proficiency bonus, but you can use your reaction to attack with a
            different weapon that you’re holding in the other hand, also without your proficiency bonus. If you would
            make more than one attack when you take the Attack action, only one attack is made without your proficiency
            bonus.


            Berserk Mastery PHB
            You’ve mastered returning pain to those who deliver it, becoming a scourge on the battlefield. You gain the
            following benefits:

            When a creature within 5 feet of you deals damage to you with a weapon or unarmed strike, you can use your
            reaction to make a melee weapon attack or unarmed strike against that creature. On a hit, you deal
            additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus.
            When a creature scores a critical hit against you, you have advantage on the first attack you make against
            that creature before the end of your next turn. If you would already have advantage, you can instead reroll
            one of the dice once.
            You have advantage on saving throws that would force you to act against your will, be frightened, or prevent
            you from attacking a creature.

            or d6 to d8).
            Your speed isn’t halved by carrying a grappled creature who is the same size category as you or smaller.

            benefits:

            You can try to hide when you are lightly obscured from the creature from which you are hiding.
            Dim light doesn’t impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
            When you are hidden from a creature and miss it with an unarmed strike or weapon attack, making the attack
            doesn’t automatically reveal your position.
            Once per turn, when you deal damage to a creature with an unarmed strike or weapon attack while hidden from
            it, you deal additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus.

            You’ve mastered the art of defending yourself, treating your armor as a second skin. While you are wearing
            medium or heavy armor with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:

            Damage that you take from weapons is reduced by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus. If this would
            reduce the damage to 0, the damage is instead reduced to 1.
            When a creature makes a melee attack against you while within your reach, whether the attack hits or misses,
            you can use your reaction to attempt to shove that creature up to 10 feet directly away from you.
            The time it takes for you to don and doff armor is reduced by half.


            Disruption Mastery PHB

            from you.
            Whenever you force a creature to make a saving throw to maintain concentration, the DC for the saving throw
            increases by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.
            You have advantage on saving throws against powers cast by creatures you can see if you’ve dealt damage to

            Dual Wield Mastery PHB
            You’ve mastered fighting with two weapons, becoming a flurry of motion. While you are wielding separate
            weapons in each hand with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:

            When you use your bonus action to engage in Two-Weapon Fighting, you can choose to forgo one or more
            attacks. For each attack you forgo, you gain a +1 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.
            You can engage in Two-Weapon Fighting even when the weapons you are wielding lack the light property.
            You can draw or stow two weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.
            When you use your bonus action to engage in Two-Weapon Fighting, you can choose to forgo your proficiency
            bonus. If you do so, you can make an additional attack with that weapon, also without your proficiency
            bonus. If you would normally make more than one attack with your bonus action, only one attack is made
            without your proficiency bonus.

            benefits:

            When you take the Attack action, you can choose to attack with haste at the expense of accuracy. Your weapon
            attack is made without the aid of your proficiency bonus, but you can use your reaction to make an
            additional weapon attack, also without your proficiency bonus. If you would make more than one attack when
            you take the Attack action, only one attack is made without your proficiency bonus.
            When a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to
            your AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you.

            wearing light or no armor and not wielding a shield, you gain the following benefits:

            When a creature misses you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to make an unarmed strike or
            weapon attack against that creature without your proficiency bonus.
            When a creature hits you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to impose a penalty to the attack
            roll equal to your proficiency bonus, potentially causing the attack to miss.
            If you are disarmed, you can use your reaction to immediately catch the weapon.


            Explosives Mastery PHB
            You’ve mastered fighting with explosives, causing untold destruction. You gain the following benefits:

            When determining the save DC of an ammunition or explosive you control, you can use 8 + your proficiency
            bonus + your Intelligence modifier, if it would be higher than the item’s DC.
            When using an ammunition or explosive that requires a saving throw and deals damage, you can take a penalty
            to the save DC equal to your proficiency bonus. If you do so, the item’s damage increases by an amount equal
            to your proficiency bonus.
            You have advantage on saving throws against ammunition and explosive you control.


            Formation Mastery PHB

            grace. You gain the following benefits:

            You learn three lightsaber forms, detailed later in this chapter. If you already know at least three
            lightsaber forms, you instead learn the remaining forms.
            Once on each of your turns, before you make a melee weapon attack, you can choose to forgo your proficiency
            bonus. If you do so, you can engage in one of your lightsaber forms without using your bonus action. If that
            form lets you make an attack, that attack is also made without your proficiency bonus.
            Once on each of your turns, before you make a melee weapon attack, you can choose to forgo your proficiency
            bonus. If you do so, and the attack hits, you can choose another creature within 5 feet of it. If the

            you gain the following benefits:

            On your turn, when you score a critical hit or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee weapon attack,
            you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action.
            When you miss with a melee weapon attack, you can use your bonus action to repeat the attack against the
            same target. Any modifications to the original attack roll, such as advantage, disadvantage, or without your
            proficiency bonus, also affect this attack roll. On a hit, this attack deals kinetic damage equal to your
            Strength modifier.
            Before you make a melee weapon attack, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits,
            you add twice your proficiency bonus to the attack’s damage.
            While wielding the weapon in two hands, you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to avoid
            being disarmed.


            Guerrilla Mastery PHB
            You’ve mastered maneuvering across the battlefield, sliding through openings that others might not see. You

            You can move through a hostile creature’s space regardless of that creature’s size.
            When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed (no action required)
            without provoking opportunity attacks from that creature.
            Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, another enemy of the creature is within 5 feet
            of it, and that enemy isn’t incapacitated, you can deal additional damage equal to twice your proficiency
            bonus.
            When a hostile creature moves to within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to Disengage and move up to
            half your speed. If you could already use your reaction to Disengage and move up to half your speed, you can
            instead move up to your full speed.


            Gunning Mastery PHB
            You’ve mastered using blasters in unique ways, controlling the battlefield. While you are wielding a blaster
            weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:

            When a creature succeeds on the saving throw against the burst or rapid property of your weapon, they take
            damage equal to your Dexterity modifier.
            When you use the burst property of a weapon, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus to the save DC.
            If you do so, each creature that fails the save takes additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus.
            When you use the rapid property of a weapon, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus to the save DC.

            bonus.
            You treat the strength number of weapons as one step lower (19 to 17, 17 to 15, 15 to 13, or 13 to 11). If

            Once per turn, you can choose to have advantage on a melee weapon attack roll against an unmounted creature
            that is smaller than your mount. If the attack hits, you deal additional damage equal to your proficiency
            bonus.
            If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half
            damage, you can use your reaction to have it instead take no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and
            only half damage if it fails.
            While mounted on a vehicle, you can use your bonus action instead of your action to take one of the
            vehicle’s actions available to you. You can’t take the same action twice in one turn.
            While mounted on a controlled beast, you can use your bonus action to have your mount make a single attack
            against a creature within its range.

            an unarmed strike.
            When you would have advantage on a melee weapon attack due to a creature being prone, you can reroll one of
            the dice once.
            When a prone creature within 5 feet of you attempts to stand, they provoke an opportunity attack from you.
            Once on each of your turns, if you move at least 10 feet in a straight line towards a creature before
            hitting it with a melee weapon attack, you deal additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus.


            Sentinel Mastery PHB
            You’ve mastered techniques to take advantage of every drop in any enemy’s guard; in tight spaces you are
            indomitable. While you are wielding a light- or vibro-weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the
            following benefits:
            Creatures within your reach provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action.
            You can use a bonus action to enter a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn. While
            in your defensive stance, you have a number of special reactions equal to your proficiency bonus that you
            can only use to make opportunity attacks. You can only take one reaction per turn.
            When you take the Dodge action, once per round, you can take two reactions on the same turn, instead of only
            one.


            Sharpshooter Mastery PHB
            You’ve mastered blaster weapons and can easily make shots that others find impossible. While you are
            wielding a blaster weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:

            Attacking at long range doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.
            Your ranged weapon attacks ignore one-quarter and half cover against targets 30 feet or greater from you. If
            your ranged weapon attacks would already ignore one-quarter and half cover against targets 30 feet or
            greater from you, they now also ignore three-quarters cover.
            Before you make an attack with a blaster weapon against a target 30 feet or greater from you, you can choose
            to forgo your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, you add twice your proficiency bonus to the attack’s
            damage.


            Shield Mastery PHB
            You’ve mastered using a shield to defend your allies as well as yourself, strategically imposing your shield

            When a creature you can see damages you, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by an amount equal
            to your proficiency bonus.
            When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half
            damage, and you succeed on the saving throw, you can use your reaction to take no damage.


            Snapshot Mastery PHB
            You’ve mastered getting up close and personal with blaster weapons, maintaining both rate of fire and
            accuracy. While you are wielding a blaster weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following
            benefits:

            When you take the Attack action targeting a creature within 30 feet, you can choose to attack rapidly at the
            expense of accuracy. Your ranged weapon attack is made without the aid of your proficiency bonus, but you
            can use your bonus action to make an additional ranged weapon attack, also without your proficiency bonus.
            If you would make more than one attack when you take the Attack action, only one attack is made without your
            proficiency bonus.
            Your ranged weapon attacks ignore one-quarter and half cover against targets within 30 feet of you. If your
            ranged weapon attacks would already ignore one-quarter and half cover against targets within 30 feet of you,
            they now also ignore three-quarters cover.
            Other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move to within 30 feet of you, and you can
            use blaster weapons when making opportunity attacks.


            Throwing Mastery PHB
            You’ve mastered the techniques of throwing weapons, readily blending the weapons with your movements. While
            you are wielding a weapon with the thrown property with which you are proficient, you gain the following
            benefits:

            Attacking at long range doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls with thrown weapons.
            Once on each of your turns, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a thrown weapon against a target within
            the weapon’s normal range without the aid of your proficiency bonus (no action required).
            When you hit a creature with a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, you have advantage on your next melee
            weapon attack against that creature before the end of your next turn.
            Once per turn, you can draw a weapon with the thrown property without using your object interaction.


            Twin-Blade Mastery PHB
            You’ve mastered fighting with double-bladed weapons, using both ends to devastating effect. While you are
            wielding a weapon with the double property with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:

            Whenever you roll the maximum on a weapon damage die against a creature, you gain a +1 bonus to the next
            attack roll you make against that creature before the end of your next turn.
            You can engage in Double-Weapon Fighting even when the weapon you are wielding lacks the light property.
            Grasping a double weapon you are wielding in only one hand with your other hand no longer requires your
            object interaction.
            Before you make a melee weapon attack, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits,
            you add your proficiency bonus to the attack’s damage.

            You’ve mastered using weapons in different ways, altering your attack patterns mid-swing. While you are
            wielding a light- or vibro-weapon with the versatile property with which you are proficient and no other
            weapons, you gain the following benefits:

            When you are the target of a melee weapon attack, you can immediately use your reaction to make a melee
            weapon attack against the target without your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s
            normal effects, and you impose disadvantage on the triggering roll.
            Once per turn, when you make an attack roll while wielding a weapon in two hands, you can attempt to follow
            up on the attack. If the attack hits, the creature must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to
            attacks with the weapon). On a failed save, the creature is pushed back 5 feet, and you can immediately move
            into the space it just vacated without provoking opportunity attacks.
            Once per turn, when you make an attack roll while wielding a weapon in one hand, the target is wielding a
            shield, and your other hand is empty, you can use your other hand to pull down the shield (no action
            required). If you do so, the creature gains no benefit to armor class from its shield for that attack.

            just vacated without provoking opportunity attacks.

        <text>BLINDED
            A blinded ship can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that relies on sight or the ship’s
            sensors.
            Attack rolls against the ship have advantage, and the ship’s attack rolls have disadvantage.


            DISABLED
            A disabled ship can’t communicate with external sources more than 1,000 feet away.
            A disabled ship can’t take actions or reactions.
            A disabled ship’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.


            IONIZED
            An ionized starship has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.


            INVISIBLE
            An invisible starship is impossible to see without the aid of powers or a special sense. For the purpose of
            hiding, the starship is heavily obscured. The starship’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or
            any tracks it leaves.
            Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage.


            SHOCKED
            A shocked starship’s speed is reduced by half.
            The starship can’t take reactions.


            STALLED
            A stalled ship is disabled (see the condition).
            Any active features controlled by the ship, such as a Tractor Beam or Gravity Well Projector, automatically
            end.
            The ship automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
            Attack rolls against the ship have advantage.


            STUNNED
            A stunned ship’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
            The ship automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
            Attack rolls against the ship have advantage.


            SYSTEM DAMAGE
            Some special abilities, or when certain conditions are met, cause a ship to sustain a special condition
            called System Damage. such as and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a
            special condition called System Damage. System Damage is measured in six levels. An effect can give a
            starship one or more levels of System Damage, as specified in the effect’s description.

            Level Effect
            1 Disadvantage on ability checks
            2 Flying speed halved and turning speed doubled
            3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
            4 Hit point maximum, shield point maximum, and shield regeneration rate halved
            5 Ship becomes permanently “used” (see the condition)
            6 Ship suffers catastrophic power failure. All primary systems fail.
            If a ship with System Damage suffers another effect that causes System Damage, its current level of System
            Damage increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.

            A ship suffers the effect of its current level of System Damage as well as all lower levels. For example, a
            ship suffering level 2 System Damage has its flying speed halved, turning speed doubled, and has
            disadvantage on ability checks.

            An effect that removes System Damage reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all
            System Damage effects (except for “used”) ending if a ship’s System Damage level is reduced below 1.

            Finishing maintenance reduces a ship’s System Damage level by 1.


            TRACTORED
            A tractored ship’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
            The condition ends if the tractoring ship is disabled (see the condition).
            The condition also ends if an effect removes the tractored ship from the reach of the tractoring ship or
            effect.


            USED
            A used starship’s value is reduced by half.
            When a deployed crew member on a used starship rolls a 1 on an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw,
            they must make a destruction saving throw. If the roll is 10 or higher, they succeed. On a failure, the ship
            suffers 1 level of System Damage.

            creature must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). Any
            creature immune to being charmed is unaffected. If you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has
            advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, for the next minute, a creature has disadvantage on Wisdom
            (Perception) checks made to perceive any creature other than you until the effect ends or until the target

        <text>As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature
            within your reach, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects, and
            you can choose to deal up to 1d8 of necrotic damage, which you suffer as well. This damage can’t be reduced
            or negated in any way.

            This power’s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra
            1d8 necrotic damage to the target, and you can increase the secondary damage to 2d8. Both damage rolls
            increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.

            make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your demands. For
            the duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom
            saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it
            succeeds on this saving throw, this power doesn’t restrict the target’s movement for that turn.

            The power ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a power that targets a hostile creature other
            than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful power on it, or if you
            end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

        <text>For the duration, you can detect electronic transmissions. When you cast the power and as your action on
            each turn until the power ends, you can focus on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If
            the creature you choose does not possess a commlink, or is not a droid or construct, the creature is
            unaffected.

            If the creature possesses a commlink or other communications device, you receive any transmissions it
            broadcasts or receives for the duration.

            Additionally, if the target is a droid or construct, you can read its “thoughts.” You initially learn the
            surface thoughts of the creature; what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either
            shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s
            mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into
            its reasoning (if any), and something that looms large in its mind (such as its current objectives). If it
            succeeds, the power ends. Either way, the target (or its pilot, if it has one) knows that you are probing
            into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its
            action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the
            power ends.

            Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this power
            is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

            You can also use this power to detect the presence of droids, constructs, or creatures bearing
            communications devices you can’t see. When you cast the power or as your action during the duration, you can
            search for transmissions within 30 feet of you. The power can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2
            inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.

            Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts or transmissions for the
            rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.

        <text>You craft a dangerous illusion in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must
            make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible
            phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target
            for the duration. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

            The hallucination includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.

            The target can use its action to examine the hallucination with an Intelligence (Investigation) check
            against your force power save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the hallucination is an
            illusion, and the power ends.

            While a target is affected by the power, the target treats the hallucination as if it were real. The target
            rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the hallucination. For example, a target
            attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the
            target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation
            for its fall - it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.

            An affected target is so convinced of the hallucination’s reality that it can even take damage from the
            illusion. A hallucination created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a hallucination
            created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the
            hallucination can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the hallucination’s area or within 5
            feet of the hallucination, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal
            damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

            Force Potency. When you cast this power using a force power slot of 3rd level or higher, the range increases
            by 20 feet, the image dimensions increase by 5 feet, and you can target one additional creature for every
            two slot levels above 2nd.

            met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak
            the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally,
            determine the circumstance that will trigger the power to deliver your message.

            When that circumstance occurs, the message is recited in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. When
            you cast this power, you can have the power end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat
            its message whenever the trigger occurs.

            The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual
            or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the message
            to play when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a bell rings within 30 feet of it.

            Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the power’s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether
            the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.

            If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack’s target to a duplicate. With
            two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.

            A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is
            destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and
            effects. The power ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

            A creature is unaffected by this power if it can’t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as
            blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.
